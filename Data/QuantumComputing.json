As state-of-the-art deep learning architectures have continued to grow in parameter count so have the compute budgets and times required to train them, increasing the need for compute-efficient methods that parallelize training. Two common approaches to parallelize the training of deep networks have been data and model parallelism. While useful, data and model parallelism suffer from diminishing returns in terms of compute efficiency for large batch sizes. In this paper, we investigate how to continue scaling compute efficiently beyond the point of diminishing returns for large batches through local parallelism, a framework which parallelizes training of individual layers in deep networks by replacing global backpropagation with truncated layer-wise backpropagation. Local parallelism enables fully asynchronous layer-wise parallelism with a low memory footprint, and requires little communication overhead compared with model parallelism. We show results in both vision and language domains across a diverse set of architectures, and find that local parallelism is particularly effective in the high-compute regime.",

In machine learning, however, artificial neural networks tend to eschew precisely designed codes, dynamics or circuits in favor of brute force optimization of a cost function, often using simple and relatively uniform initial architectures. Two recent developments have emerged within machine learning that create an opportunity to connect these seemingly divergent perspectives. First, structured architectures are used, including dedicated systems for attention, recursion and various forms of short- and long-term memory storage. Second, cost functions and training procedures have become more complex and are varied across layers and over time. Here we think about the brain in terms of these ideas. We hypothesize that (1) the brain optimizes cost functions, (2) these cost functions are diverse and differ across brain locations and over development, and (3) optimization operates within a pre-structured architecture matched to the computational problems posed by behavior. Such a heterogeneously optimized system, enabled by a series of interacting cost functions, serves to make learning data-efficient and precisely targeted to the needs of the organism. We suggest directions by which neuroscience could seek to refine and test these hypotheses.",

Still, the operating conditions of current autonomous cars are mostly restricted to ideal scenarios. This means that driving in challenging illumination conditions such as night, sunrise, and sunset remains an open problem. In these cases, standard cameras are being pushed to their limits in terms of low light and high dynamic range performance. To address these challenges, we propose, DSEC, a new dataset that contains such demanding illumination conditions and provides a rich set of sensory data. DSEC offers data from a wide-baseline stereo setup of two color frame cameras and two high-resolution monochrome event cameras. In addition, we collect lidar data and RTK GPS measurements, both hardware synchronized with all camera data. One of the distinctive features of this dataset is the inclusion of high-resolution event cameras. Event cameras have received increasing attention for their high temporal resolution and high dynamic range performance. However, due to their novelty, event camera datasets in driving scenarios are rare. This work presents the first high-resolution, large-scale stereo dataset with event cameras. The dataset contains 53 sequences collected by driving in a variety of illumination conditions and provides ground truth disparity for the development and evaluation of event-based stereo algorithms.",

A lack of available recordings from Neuromorphic Vision sensors means that data must typically be recorded specifically for dataset creation rather than collecting and labelling existing data. The task is further complicated by a desire to simultaneously provide traditional frame-based recordings to allow for direct comparison with traditional Computer Vision algorithms. Here we propose a method for converting existing Computer Vision static image datasets into Neuromorphic Vision datasets using an actuated pan-tilt camera platform. Moving the sensor rather than the scene or image is a more biologically realistic approach to sensing and eliminates timing artifacts introduced by monitor updates when simulating motion on a computer monitor. We present conversion of two popular image datasets (MNIST and Caltech101) which have played important roles in the development of Computer Vision, and we provide performance metrics on these datasets using spike-based recognition algorithms. This work contributes datasets for future use in the field, as well as results from spike-based algorithms against which future works can compare. Furthermore, by converting datasets already popular in Computer Vision, we enable more direct comparison with frame-based approaches.",

These sensors have great potential for high-speed robotics and computer vision because they allow us to combine the benefits of conventional cameras with those of event-based sensors: low latency, high temporal resolution, and very high dynamic range. However, new algorithms are required to exploit the sensor characteristics and cope with its unconventional output, which consists of a stream of asynchronous brightness changes (called \"events\") and synchronous grayscale frames. For this purpose, we present and release a collection of datasets captured with a DAVIS in a variety of synthetic and real environments, which we hope will motivate research on new algorithms for high-speed and high-dynamic-range robotics and computer-vision applications. In addition to global-shutter intensity images and asynchronous events, we provide inertial measurements and ground-truth camera poses from a motion-capture system. The latter allows comparing the pose accuracy of ego-motion estimation algorithms quantitatively. All the data are released both as standard text files and binary files (i.e., rosbag). This paper provides an overview of the available data and describes a simulator that we release open-source to create synthetic event-camera data.",

Unfortunately, this design does not pay significant attention to mobile services in underserved areas. In this context, the use of aerial radio access networks (ARANs) is a promising strategy to complement existing terrestrial communication systems. Involving airborne components such as unmanned aerial vehicles, drones, and satellites, ARANs can quickly establish a flexible access infrastructure on demand. ARANs are expected to support the development of seamless mobile communication systems toward a comprehensive sixth-generation (6G) global access infrastructure. This paper provides an overview of recent studies regarding ARANs in the literature. First, we investigate related work to identify areas for further exploration in terms of recent knowledge advancements and analyses. Second, we define the scope and methodology of this study. Then, we describe ARAN architecture and its fundamental features for the development of 6G networks. In particular, we analyze the system model from several perspectives, including transmission propagation, energy consumption, communication latency, and network mobility. Furthermore, we introduce technologies that enable the success of ARAN implementations in terms of energy replenishment, operational management, and data delivery. Subsequently, we discuss application scenarios envisioned for these technologies. Finally, we highlight ongoing research efforts and trends toward 6G ARANs.",

A new algorithm named QiBAM (quantum indexed bidirectional associative memory) is proposed, that uses approximate pattern-matching based on Hamming distances. QiBAM extends the Grover's search algorithm in two ways to allow for: (1) approximate matches needed for read errors in genomics, and (2) a distributed search for multiple solutions over the quantum encoding of DNA sequences. This approach gives a quadratic speedup over the classical algorithm. A full implementation of the algorithm is provided and verified using the OpenQL compiler and QX simulator framework.

These include network architecture, capacity, weight distribution, and the type of inter-layer connections. Techniques are continuously emerging to efficiently train sparse neural networks, which may have activation sparsity, quantization, and memristive noise. In this paper, we present an extended Design Space Exploration (DSE) methodology to quantify the benefits and limitations of dense and sparse mapping schemes for a variety of network architectures. While sparsity of connectivity promotes less power consumption and is often optimized for extracting localized features, its performance on tiled RRAM arrays may be more susceptible to noise due to under-parameterization, when compared to dense mapping schemes. Moreover, we present a case study quantifying and formalizing the trade-offs of typical non-idealities introduced into 1-Transistor-1-Resistor (1T1R) tiled memristive architectures and the size of modular crossbar tiles using the CIFAR-10 dataset.",

The toolkit is under active development and is centered around the concept of an \"analog tile\" which captures the computations performed on a crossbar array. Analog tiles are building blocks that can be used to extend existing network modules with analog components and compose arbitrary artificial neural networks (ANNs) using the flexibility of the PyTorch framework. Analog tiles can be conveniently configured to emulate a plethora of different analog hardware characteristics and their non-idealities, such as device-to-device and cycle-to-cycle variations, resistive device response curves, and weight and output noise. Additionally, the toolkit makes it possible to design custom unit cell configurations and to use advanced analog optimization algorithms such as Tiki-Taka. Moreover, the backward and update behavior can be set to \"ideal\" to enable hardware-aware training features for chips that target inference acceleration only. To evaluate the inference accuracy of such chips over time, we provide statistical programming noise and drift models calibrated on phase-change memory hardware. Our new toolkit is fully GPU accelerated and can be used to conveniently estimate the impact of material properties and non-idealities of future analog technology on the accuracy for arbitrary ANNs.",

                        "Citation Paper Abstract": "Abstract:In this paper, we investigate the resource allocation design for intelligent reflecting surface (IRS)-assisted full-duplex (FD) cognitive radio systems. In particular, a secondary network employs an FD base station (BS) for serving multiple half-duplex downlink (DL) and uplink (UL) users simultaneously. An IRS is deployed to enhance the performance of the secondary network while helping to mitigate the interference caused to the primary users (PUs). The DL transmit beamforming vectors and the UL receive beamforming vectors at the FD BS, the transmit power of the UL users, and the phase shift matrix at the IRS are jointly optimized for maximization of the total sum rate of the secondary system. The design task is formulated as a non-convex optimization problem taking into account the imperfect knowledge of the PUs' channel state information (CSI) and their maximum interference tolerance. Since the maximum interference tolerance constraint is intractable, we apply a safe approximation to transform it into a convex constraint. To efficiently handle the resulting approximated optimization problem, which is still non-convex, we develop an iterative block coordinate descent (BCD)-based algorithm. This algorithm exploits semidefinite relaxation, a penalty method, and successive convex approximation and is guaranteed to converge to a stationary point of the approximated optimization problem. Our simulation results do not only reveal that the proposed scheme yields a substantially higher system sum rate for the secondary system than several baseline schemes, but also confirm its robustness against CSI uncertainty. Besides, our results illustrate the tremendous potential of IRS for managing the various types of interference arising in FD cognitive radio networks.",

Meanwhile, intelligent reflecting surface (IRS), also known as reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS), has been recently proposed as a promising approach to enhance energy efficiency (EE) of wireless communication systems through intelligently reconfiguring the channel environment. To improve both SE and EE, in this paper, we introduce multiple IRSs to a downlink multiple-input single-output (MISO) CR system, in which a single SU coexists with a primary network with multiple primary user receivers (PU-RXs). Our design objective is to maximize the achievable rate of SU subject to a total transmit power constraint on the SU transmitter (SU-TX) and interference temperature constraints on the PU-RXs, by jointly optimizing the beamforming at SU-TX and the reflecting coefficients at each IRS. Both perfect and imperfect channel state information (CSI) cases are considered in the optimization. Numerical results demonstrate that the introduction of IRS can significantly improve the achievable rate of SU under both perfect and imperfect CSI cases.",

In this letter, we aim to investigate the phase-amplitude-frequency relationship of the reflected signals and propose a practical model of reflection coefficient for an IRS-aided wideband system.

Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) can be used as a promising way to improve the energy efficiency of wireless communications with less complexity and hardware cost. Most existing studies consider the cases with ideal hardware, however, both physical transceiver and IRS suffer from non-negligible hardware impairments which may greatly degrade the system performance. In this paper, by taking hardware impairments into consideration, we focus on the energy efficiency analysis of IRS system. Our first contribution is to derive the optimal receive combining and transmit beamforming vectors. After that, we characterize the asymptotic channel capacity. With the derived asymptotic channel capacity and the power consumption model, the analytical upper and lower bounds of energy efficiency are provided. Our results show that an IRS system can achieve both high spectral efficiency and high energy efficiency with moderate number of antennas. This observation is encouraging for that there is no need to cost a lot on expensive high-quality antennas, which corresponds to the requirements of new communication paradigms.",

However, the current proofs of concept require complex operations for the RIS configuration, which are mainly realized via wired control connections. In this paper, we present a deep learning method for efficient online wireless configuration of RISs when deployed in indoor communication environments. According to the proposed method, a database of coordinate fingerprints is implemented during an offline training phase. This fingerprinting database is used to train the weights and bias of a properly designed Deep Neural Network (DNN), whose role is to unveil the mapping between the measured coordinate information at a user location and the configuration of the RIS's unit cells that maximizes this user's received signal strength. During the online phase of the presented method, the trained DNN is fed with the measured position information at the target user to output the optimal phase configurations of the RIS for signal power focusing on this intended location. Our realistic simulation results using ray tracing on a three dimensional indoor environment demonstrate that the proposed DNN-based configuration method exhibits its merits for all considered cases, and effectively increases the achievable throughput at the target user location.",

In this paper, we study an IRS-aided multiuser multiple-input single-output (MISO) wireless system and adopt the two-timescale (TTS) transmission to reduce the signal processing complexity and channel training overhead as compared to the existing schemes based on the instantaneous channel state information (I-CSI), and at the same time, exploit the multiuser channel diversity in transmission scheduling. Specifically, the long-term passive beamforming is designed based on the statistical CSI (S-CSI) of all links, while the short-term active beamforming is designed to cater to the I-CSI of all users' reconfigured channels with optimized IRS phase shifts. We aim to minimize the average transmit power at the access point (AP), subject to the users' individual quality of service (QoS) constraints. The formulated stochastic optimization problem is non-convex and difficult to solve since the long-term and short-term design variables are complicatedly coupled in the QoS constraints. To tackle this problem, we propose an efficient algorithm, called the primal-dual decomposition based TTS joint active and passive beamforming (PDD-TJAPB), where the original problem is decomposed into a long-term problem and a family of short-term problems, and the deep unfolding technique is employed to extract gradient information from the short-term problems to construct a convex surrogate problem for the long-term problem.

As a consequence, the proposed approach does not require the estimation of the instantaneous channel state information (CSI) for system optimization, thus significantly relaxing (or even avoiding) the need of frequently reconfiguring the IRSs, which constitutes one of the most critical issues in IRS-assisted systems.

                        "Citation Paper Abstract": "Abstract:In intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) aided wireless communication systems, channel state information (CSI) is crucial to achieve its promising passive beamforming gains. However, CSI errors are inevitable in practice and generally correlated over the IRS reflecting elements due to the limited training with discrete phase shifts, which degrade the data transmission rate and reliability. In this paper, we focus on investigating the effect of CSI errors to the outage performance in an IRS-aided multiuser downlink communication system. Specifically, we aim to jointly optimize the active transmit precoding vectors at the access point (AP) and passive discrete phase shifts at the IRS to minimize the AP's transmit power, subject to the constraints on the maximum CSI-error induced outage probability for the users. First, we consider the single-user case and derive the user's outage probability in terms of the mean signal power (MSP) and variance of the received signal at the user. Since there is a trade-off in tuning these two parameters to minimize the outage probability, we propose to maximize their weighted sum with the optimal weight found by one-dimensional search. Then, for the general multiuser case, since the users' outage probabilities are difficult to obtain in closed-form due to the inter-user interference, we propose a novel constrained stochastic successive convex approximation (CSSCA) algorithm, which replaces the non-convex outage probability constraints with properly designed convex surrogate approximations. Simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed robust beamfoming algorithms and show their significant performance improvement over various benchmark schemes.",

In a smart radio environment, surfaces are capable of manipulating the propagation of incident electromagnetic waves in a programmable manner to actively alter the channel realization, which turns the wireless channel into a controllable system block that can be optimized to improve overall system performance. In this article, we provide a tutorial overview of reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) for wireless communications. We describe the working principles of reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) and elaborate on different candidate implementations using metasurfaces and reflectarrays. We discuss the channel models suitable for both implementations and examine the feasibility of obtaining accurate channel estimates. Furthermore, we discuss the aspects that differentiate RIS optimization from precoding for traditional MIMO arrays highlighting both the arising challenges and the potential opportunities associated with this emerging technology. Finally, we present numerical results to illustrate the power of an RIS in shaping the key properties of a MIMO channel.",

BFLOAT16 is attractive for Deep Learning training for two reasons: the range of values it can represent is the same as that of IEEE 754 floating-point format (FP32) and conversion to/from FP32 is simple. Maintaining the same range as FP32 is important to ensure that no hyper-parameter tuning is required for convergence; e.g., IEEE 754 compliant half-precision floating point (FP16) requires hyper-parameter tuning. In this paper, we discuss the flow of tensors and various key operations in mixed precision training, and delve into details of operations, such as the rounding modes for converting FP32 tensors to BFLOAT16. We have implemented a method to emulate BFLOAT16 operations in Tensorflow, Caffe2, IntelCaffe, and Neon for our experiments. Our results show that deep learning training using BFLOAT16 tensors achieves the same state-of-the-art (SOTA) results across domains as FP32 tensors in the same number of iterations and with no changes to hyper-parameters.",

They have been shown to be effective in special-purpose accelerators for a limited set of neural network applications.\nWe present the Programmable Ultra-efficient Memristor-based Accelerator (PUMA) which enhances memristor crossbars with general purpose execution units to enable the acceleration of a wide variety of Machine Learning (ML) inference workloads. PUMA's microarchitecture techniques exposed through a specialized Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) retain the efficiency of in-memory computing and analog circuitry, without compromising programmability.\nWe also present the PUMA compiler which translates high-level code to PUMA ISA. The compiler partitions the computational graph and optimizes instruction scheduling and register allocation to generate code for large and complex workloads to run on thousands of spatial cores.\nWe have developed a detailed architecture simulator that incorporates the functionality, timing, and power models of PUMA's components to evaluate performance and energy consumption. A PUMA accelerator running at 1 GHz can reach area and power efficiency of $577~GOPS/s/mm^2$ and $837~GOPS/s/W$, respectively. Our evaluation of diverse ML applications from image recognition, machine translation, and language modelling (5M-800M synapses) shows that PUMA achieves up to $2,446\\times$ energy and $66\\times$ latency improvement for inference compared to state-of-the-art GPUs.

This paper evaluates a custom ASIC---called a Tensor Processing Unit (TPU)---deployed in datacenters since 2015 that accelerates the inference phase of neural networks (NN). The heart of the TPU is a 65,536 8-bit MAC matrix multiply unit that offers a peak throughput of 92 TeraOps/second (TOPS) and a large (28 MiB) software-managed on-chip memory. The TPU's deterministic execution model is a better match to the 99th-percentile response-time requirement of our NN applications than are the time-varying optimizations of CPUs and GPUs (caches, out-of-order execution, multithreading, multiprocessing, prefetching, ...) that help average throughput more than guaranteed latency. The lack of such features helps explain why, despite having myriad MACs and a big memory, the TPU is relatively small and low power. We compare the TPU to a server-class Intel Haswell CPU and an Nvidia K80 GPU, which are contemporaries deployed in the same datacenters. Our workload, written in the high-level TensorFlow framework, uses production NN applications (MLPs, CNNs, and LSTMs) that represent 95% of our datacenters' NN inference demand. Despite low utilization for some applications, the TPU is on average about 15X - 30X faster than its contemporary GPU or CPU, with TOPS/Watt about 30X - 80X higher. Moreover, using the GPU's GDDR5 memory in the TPU would triple achieved TOPS and raise TOPS/Watt to nearly 70X the GPU and 200X the CPU.",

In this paper, we consider how a quantum network-nodes equipped with limited quantum processing capabilities connected via lossy optical links-can distribute high-rate entanglement simultaneously between multiple pairs of users (multiple flows). We develop protocols for such quantum \"repeater\" nodes, which enable a pair of users to achieve large gains in entanglement rates over using a linear chain of quantum repeaters, by exploiting the diversity of multiple paths in the network. Additionally, we develop repeater protocols that enable multiple user pairs to generate entanglement simultaneously at rates that can far exceed what is possible with repeaters time sharing among assisting individual entanglement flows. Our results suggest that the early-stage development of quantum memories with short coherence times and implementations of probabilistic Bell-state measurements can have a much more profound impact on quantum networks than may be apparent from analyzing linear repeater chains. This framework should spur the development of a general quantum network theory, bringing together quantum memory physics, quantum information theory, and computer network theory.",

In this work, we focus on two-dimensional quantum networks based on optical quantum technologies using dual-rail photonic qubits for the building of a fail-safe quantum internet. We lay out a quantum network architecture for entanglement distribution between distant parties using a Bravais lattice topology, with the technological constraint that quantum repeaters equipped with quantum memories are not easily accessible. We provide a robust protocol for simultaneous entanglement distribution between two distant groups of parties on this network. We also discuss a memory-based quantum network architecture that can be implemented on networks with an arbitrary topology. We examine networks with bow-tie lattice and Archimedean lattice topologies and use percolation theory to quantify the robustness of the networks. In particular, we provide figures of merit on the loss parameter of the optical medium that depend only on the topology of the network and quantify the robustness of the network against intermittent photon loss and intermittent failure of nodes. These figures of merit can be used to compare the robustness of different network topologies in order to determine the best topology in a given real-world scenario, which is critical in the realization of the quantum internet.",

For all these tasks, we need to determine the optimal point-to-point rates that are achievable by two remote parties at the ends of a quantum channel, without restrictions on their local operations and classical communication, which can be unlimited and two-way. These two-way assisted capacities represent the ultimate rates that are reachable without quantum repeaters. By constructing an upperbound based on the relative entropy of entanglement and devising a dimension-independent technique dubbed \"teleportation stretching\", we establish these capacities for many fundamental channels, namely bosonic lossy channels, quantum-limited amplifiers, dephasing and erasure channels in arbitrary dimension. In particular, we determine the fundamental rate-loss trade-off affecting any protocol of quantum key distribution.

Under a pessimistic fabrication model for the silicon-on-insulator process, we demonstrate a dramatic fidelity improvement for the linear optics CNOT and CPHASE gates and, showing the scalability of this approach, the iterative phase estimation algorithm built from individually optimized gates.

However, the limited size of crossbars and heavy routing congestion impedes the NCS implementations of big neural networks. In this paper, we propose a two-step framework (namely, group scissor) to scale NCS designs to big neural networks. The first step is rank clipping, which integrates low-rank approximation into the training to reduce total crossbar area. The second step is group connection deletion, which structurally prunes connections to reduce routing congestion between crossbars. Tested on convolutional neural networks of LeNet on MNIST database and ConvNet on CIFAR-10 database, our experiments show significant reduction of crossbar area and routing area in NCS designs. Without accuracy loss, rank clipping reduces total crossbar area to 13.62\\% and 51.81\\% in the NCS designs of LeNet and ConvNet, respectively. Following rank clipping, group connection deletion further reduces the routing area of LeNet and ConvNet to 8.1\\% and 52.06\\%, respectively.",

However, the recent trend to design Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) for achieving human-like cognitive abilities poses significant challenges towards the scalable design of neuromorphic systems (due to the increase in computation/storage demands). Network pruning [7] is a powerful technique to remove redundant connections for designing optimally connected (maximally sparse) DNNs. However, such pruning techniques induce irregular connections that are incoherent to the crossbar structure. Eventually they produce DNNs with highly inefficient hardware realizations (in terms of area and energy). In this work, we propose TraNNsformer - an integrated training framework that transforms DNNs to enable their efficient realization on MCA-based systems. TraNNsformer first prunes the connectivity matrix while forming clusters with the remaining connections. Subsequently, it retrains the network to fine tune the connections and reinforce the clusters. This is done iteratively to transform the original connectivity into an optimally pruned and maximally clustered mapping. Without accuracy loss, TraNNsformer reduces the area (energy) consumption by 28% - 55% (49% - 67%) with respect to the original network. Compared to network pruning, TraNNsformer achieves 28% - 49% (15% - 29%) area (energy) savings. Furthermore, TraNNsformer is a technology-aware framework that allows mapping a given DNN to any MCA size permissible by the memristive technology for reliable operations.",

In this paper, we introduce the XNOR Neural Engine (XNE), a fully digital configurable hardware accelerator IP for BNNs, integrated within a microcontroller unit (MCU) equipped with an autonomous I/O subsystem and hybrid SRAM / standard cell memory. The XNE is able to fully compute convolutional and dense layers in autonomy or in cooperation with the core in the MCU to realize more complex behaviors. We show post-synthesis results in 65nm and 22nm technology for the XNE IP and post-layout results in 22nm for the full MCU indicating that this system can drop the energy cost per binary operation to 21.6fJ per operation at 0.4V, and at the same time is flexible and performant enough to execute state-of-the-art BNN topologies such as ResNet-34 in less than 2.2mJ per frame at 8.9 fps.",

XNOR-Networks approximate convolutions using primarily binary operations. This results in 58x faster convolutional operations and 32x memory savings. XNOR-Nets offer the possibility of running state-of-the-art networks on CPUs (rather than GPUs) in real-time. Our binary networks are simple, accurate, efficient, and work on challenging visual tasks. We evaluate our approach on the ImageNet classification task. The classification accuracy with a Binary-Weight-Network version of AlexNet is only 2.9% less than the full-precision AlexNet (in top-1 measure).

Phys. 228, 4468 (2009)] in order to overcome the memory limitations of a single GPU which enables us to simulate significantly larger systems. Using multi-spin coding techniques, we are able to accelerate simulations on a single GPU by factors up to 35 compared to an optimized single Central Processor Unit (CPU) core implementation which employs multi-spin coding. By combining the Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) with the Message Parsing Interface (MPI) on the CPU level, a single Ising lattice can be updated by a cluster of GPUs in parallel. For large systems, the computation time scales nearly linearly with the number of GPUs used. As proof of concept we reproduce the critical temperature of the 2D Ising model using finite size scaling techniques.",

Public blockchains, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, enable secure peer-to-peer applications like crypto-currency or smart contracts. Their security and performance are well studied. This paper concerns recent private blockchain systems designed with stronger security (trust) assumption and performance requirement. These systems target and aim to disrupt applications which have so far been implemented on top of database systems, for example banking, finance applications. Multiple platforms for private blockchains are being actively developed and fine tuned. However, there is a clear lack of a systematic framework with which different systems can be analyzed and compared against each other. Such a framework can be used to assess blockchains' viability as another distributed data processing platform, while helping developers to identify bottlenecks and accordingly improve their platforms.\nIn this paper, we first describe BlockBench, the first evaluation framework for analyzing private blockchains. It serves as a fair means of comparison for different platforms and enables deeper understanding of different system design choices. Any private blockchain can be integrated to BlockBench via simple APIs and benchmarked against workloads that are based on real and synthetic smart contracts. BlockBench measures overall and component-wise performance in terms of throughput, latency, scalability and fault-tolerance. Next, we use BlockBench to conduct comprehensive evaluation of three major private blockchains: Ethereum, Parity and Hyperledger Fabric. The results demonstrate that these systems are still far from displacing current database systems in traditional data processing workloads. Furthermore, there are gaps in performance among the three systems which are attributed to the design choices at different layers of the software stack.",

By invoking these circuits as oracles within the recently introduced \"qubitization\" framework, one can use quantum phase estimation to sample states in the Hamiltonian eigenbasis with optimal query complexity $O(\\lambda / \\epsilon)$ where $\\lambda$ is an absolute sum of Hamiltonian coefficients and $\\epsilon$ is target precision. For both the Hubbard model and electronic structure Hamiltonian in a second quantized basis diagonalizing the Coulomb operator, our circuits have T gate complexity $O({N + \\log (1/\\epsilon}))$ where $N$ is number of orbitals in the basis. This enables sampling in the eigenbasis of electronic structure Hamiltonians with T complexity $O(N^3 /\\epsilon + N^2 \\log(1/\\epsilon)/\\epsilon)$. Compared to prior approaches, our algorithms are asymptotically more efficient in gate complexity and require fewer T gates near the classically intractable regime. Compiling to surface code fault-tolerant gates and assuming per gate error rates of one part in a thousand reveals that one can error correct phase estimation on interesting instances of these problems beyond the current capabilities of classical methods using only about a million superconducting qubits in a matter of hours.",

Our cost model assumes that the attack is run on a surface code based fault-tolerant quantum computer. Our estimates rely on a time-area metric that costs the number of logical qubits times the depth of the circuit in units of surface code cycles. As a surface code cycle involves a significant classical processing stage, our cost estimates allow for crude, but direct, comparisons of classical and quantum algorithms.\nWe exhibit a circuit for a pre-image attack on SHA-256 that is approximately $2^{153.8}$ surface code cycles deep and requires approximately $2^{12.6}$ logical qubits. This yields an overall cost of $2^{166.4}$ logical-qubit-cycles. Likewise we exhibit a SHA3-256 circuit that is approximately $2^{146.5}$ surface code cycles deep and requires approximately $2^{20}$ logical qubits for a total cost of, again, $2^{166.5}$ logical-qubit-cycles. Both attacks require on the order of $2^{128}$ queries in a quantum black-box model, hence our results suggest that executing these attacks may be as much as $275$ billion times more expensive than one would expect from the simple query analysis.",

To this end, a basic block based on the cosine-sine decomposition method is suggested which contains $l$ qubits. In addition, a previously proposed quantum-logic synthesis method based on quantum Shannon decomposition is recursively applied to reach unitary gates over $l$ qubits. Then, the basic block is used and some optimizations are applied to remove redundant gates. It is shown that the exact value of $l$ affects the number of one-qubit and CNOT gates in the proposed method. In comparison to the previous synthesis methods, the value of $l$ is examined consequently to improve either the number of CNOT gates or the total number of gates. The proposed approach is further analyzed by considering the nearest neighbor limitation. According to our evaluation, the number of CNOT gates is increased by at most a factor of $\\frac{5}{3}$ if the nearest neighbor interaction is applied.",

                        "Citation Paper Abstract": "Abstract:In the past years, quantum computers more and more have evolved from an academic idea to an upcoming reality. IBM's project IBM Q can be seen as evidence of this progress. Launched in March 2017 with the goal to provide access to quantum computers for a broad audience, this allowed users to conduct quantum experiments on a 5-qubit and, since June 2017, also on a 16-qubit quantum computer (called IBM QX2 and IBM QX3, respectively). Revised versions of these 5-qubit and 16-qubit quantum computers (named IBM QX4 and IBM QX5, respectively) are available since September 2017. In order to use these, the desired quantum functionality (e.g. provided in terms of a quantum circuit) has to be properly mapped so that the underlying physical constraints are satisfied - a complex task. This demands solutions to automatically and efficiently conduct this mapping process. In this paper, we propose a methodology which addresses this problem, i.e. maps the given quantum functionality to a realization which satisfies all constraints given by the architecture and, at the same time, keeps the overhead in terms of additionally required quantum gates minimal. The proposed methodology is generic, can easily be configured for similar future architectures, and is fully integrated into IBM's SDK. Experimental evaluations show that the proposed approach clearly outperforms IBM's own mapping solution. In fact, for many quantum circuits, the proposed approach determines a mapping to the IBM architecture within minutes, while IBM's solution suffers from long runtimes and runs into a timeout of 1 hour in several cases. As an additional benefit, the proposed approach yields mapped circuits with smaller costs (i.e. fewer additional gates are required). All implementations of the proposed methodology is publicly available at this http URL.",

In contrast to conventional computing, the latter task is nontrivial because the state-space of an n-qubit register is not finite and contains exponential superpositions of classical bit strings. Our proposed circuits are asymptotically optimal for respective tasks and improve published results by at least a factor of two.\nThe circuits for generic quantum computation constructed by our algorithms are the most efficient known today in terms of the number of expensive gates (quantum controlled-NOTs). They are based on an analogue of the Shannon decomposition of Boolean functions and a new circuit block, quantum multiplexor, that generalizes several known constructions. A theoretical lower bound implies that our circuits cannot be improved by more than a factor of two. We additionally show how to accommodate the severe architectural limitation of using only nearest-neighbor gates that is representative of current implementation technologies. This increases the number of gates by almost an order of magnitude, but preserves the asymptotic optimality of gate counts.",

The depth of the circuit grows linearly with p times (at worst) the number of constraints. If p is fixed, that is, independent of the input size, the algorithm makes use of efficient classical preprocessing. If p grows with the input size a different strategy is proposed.

In this work we extend the general theory of this algorithm and suggest algorithmic improvements for practical implementations. Specifically, we develop a variational adiabatic ansatz and explore unitary coupled cluster where we establish a connection from second order unitary coupled cluster to universal gate sets through relaxation of exponential splitting. We introduce the concept of quantum variational error suppression that allows some errors to be suppressed naturally in this algorithm on a pre-threshold quantum device. Additionally, we analyze truncation and correlated sampling in Hamiltonian averaging as ways to reduce the cost of this procedure. Finally, we show how the use of modern derivative free optimization techniques can offer dramatic computational savings of up to three orders of magnitude over previously used optimization techniques.",

We improve an existing algorithm to prepare an arbitrary Slater determinant by exploiting a unitary symmetry. We also present a quantum algorithm to prepare an arbitrary fermionic Gaussian state with $O(N^2)$ gates and $O(N)$ circuit depth. Both algorithms are optimal in the sense that the numbers of parameters in the quantum circuits are equal to those to describe the quantum states. Furthermore, we propose an algorithm to implement the 2-dimensional (2D) fermionic Fourier transformation on a 2D qubit array with only $O(N^{1.5})$ gates and $O(\\sqrt N)$ circuit depth, which is the minimum depth required for quantum information to travel across the qubit array. We also present methods to simulate each time step in the evolution of the 2D Fermi-Hubbard model---again on a 2D qubit array---with $O(N)$ gates and $O(\\sqrt N)$ circuit depth.

These limitations of classical computational methods have made even few-atom molecular structures problems of practical interest for medium-sized quantum computers. Yet, thus far experimental implementations have been restricted to molecules involving only Period I elements. Here, we demonstrate the experimental optimization of up to six-qubit Hamiltonian problems with over a hundred Pauli terms, determining the ground state energy for molecules of increasing size, up to BeH2. This is enabled by a hardware-efficient variational quantum eigensolver with trial states specifically tailored to the available interactions in our quantum processor, combined with a compact encoding of fermionic Hamiltonians and a robust stochastic optimization routine. We further demonstrate the flexibility of our approach by applying the technique to a problem of quantum magnetism. Across all studied problems, we find agreement between experiment and numerical simulations with a noisy model of the device. These results help elucidate the requirements for scaling the method to larger systems, and aim at bridging the gap between problems at the forefront of high-performance computing and their implementation on quantum hardware.",

Dynamically remapping logical qubits to physical qubits in the compiler is needed to enable the two-qubit gates in the algorithm, which introduces additional operations and inevitably reduces the fidelity of the algorithm. Previous solutions in finding such remapping suffer from high complexity, poor initial mapping quality, and limited flexibility and controllability.\nTo address these drawbacks mentioned above, this paper proposes a SWAP-based BidiREctional heuristic search algorithm SABRE, which is applicable to NISQ devices with arbitrary connections between qubits. By optimizing every search attempt,globally optimizing the initial mapping using a novel reverse traversal technique, introducing the decay effect to enable the trade-off between the depth and the number of gates of the entire algorithm, SABRE outperforms the best known algorithm with exponential speedup and comparable or better results on various benchmarks.",

Existing quantum hardware cannot well support the control flow, significantly limiting the range of quantum software executable on the hardware. By analyzing the constraints in the control microarchitecture, we found that existing quantum assembly languages are either too high-level or too restricted to support comprehensive flow control on the hardware. Also, as observed with the quantum microinstruction set QuMIS, the quantum instruction set architecture (QISA) design may suffer from limited scalability and flexibility because of microarchitectural constraints. It is an open challenge to design a scalable and flexible QISA which provides a comprehensive abstraction of the quantum hardware.\nIn this paper, we propose an executable QISA, called eQASM, that can be translated from quantum assembly language (QASM), supports comprehensive quantum program flow control, and is executed on a quantum control microarchitecture. With efficient timing specification, single-operation-multiple-qubit execution, and a very-long-instruction-word architecture, eQASM presents better scalability than QuMIS. The definition of eQASM focuses on the assembly level to be expressive. Quantum operations are configured at compile time instead of being defined at QISA design time. We instantiate eQASM into a 32-bit instruction set targeting a seven-qubit superconducting quantum processor. We validate our design by performing several experiments on a two-qubit quantum processor.",

                        "Citation Paper Abstract": "Abstract:Quantum computing becomes viable when a quantum state can be preserved from environmentally-induced error. If quantum bits (qubits) are sufficiently reliable, errors are sparse and quantum error correction (QEC) is capable of identifying and correcting them. Adding more qubits improves the preservation by guaranteeing increasingly larger clusters of errors will not cause logical failure - a key requirement for large-scale systems. Using QEC to extend the qubit lifetime remains one of the outstanding experimental challenges in quantum computing. Here, we report the protection of classical states from environmental bit-flip errors and demonstrate the suppression of these errors with increasing system size. We use a linear array of nine qubits, which is a natural precursor of the two-dimensional surface code QEC scheme, and track errors as they occur by repeatedly performing projective quantum non-demolition (QND) parity measurements. Relative to a single physical qubit, we reduce the failure rate in retrieving an input state by a factor of 2.7 for five qubits and a factor of 8.5 for nine qubits after eight cycles. Additionally, we tomographically verify preservation of the non-classical Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state. The successful suppression of environmentally-induced errors strongly motivates further research into the many exciting challenges associated with building a large-scale superconducting quantum computer.",

Motivated by the usefulness of tensor networks for machine learning in the classical context, we propose quantum computing approaches to both discriminative and generative learning, with circuits based on tree and matrix product state tensor networks that could have benefits for near-term devices. The result is a unified framework where classical and quantum computing can benefit from the same theoretical and algorithmic developments, and the same model can be trained classically then transferred to the quantum setting for additional optimization. Tensor network circuits can also provide qubit-efficient schemes where, depending on the architecture, the number of physical qubits required scales only logarithmically with, or independently of the input or output data sizes. We demonstrate our proposals with numerical experiments, training a discriminative model to perform handwriting recognition using a optimization procedure that could be carried out on quantum hardware, and testing the noise resilience of the trained model.",

Our model enjoys efficient learning analogous to the density matrix renormalization group method, which allows dynamically adjusting dimensions of the tensors and offers an efficient direct sampling approach for generative tasks. We apply our method to generative modeling of several standard datasets including the Bars and Stripes, random binary patterns and the MNIST handwritten digits to illustrate the abilities, features and drawbacks of our model over popular generative models such as Hopfield model, Boltzmann machines and generative adversarial networks.

A suitable design approach are variational circuits where the parameters of gates are learnt, an approach that is particularly fruitful for applications in machine learning. In this paper, we propose a low-depth variational quantum algorithm for supervised learning. The input feature vectors are encoded into the amplitudes of a quantum system, and a quantum circuit of parametrised single and two-qubit gates together with a single-qubit measurement is used to classify the inputs. This circuit architecture ensures that the number of learnable parameters is poly-logarithmic in the input dimension. We propose a quantum-classical training scheme where the analytical gradients of the model can be estimated by running several slightly adapted versions of the variational circuit. We show with simulations that the circuit-centric quantum classifier performs well on standard classical benchmark datasets while requiring dramatically fewer parameters than other methods. We also evaluate sensitivity of the classification to state preparation and parameter noise, introduce a quantum version of dropout regularisation and provide a graphical representation of quantum gates as highly symmetric linear layers of a neural network.",

An important open question is what characterizes the representational power of deep and shallow neural networks, which is of fundamental interest due to popularity of the deep learning methods. Here, we give a rigorous proof that a deep neural network can efficiently represent most physical states, including those generated by any polynomial size quantum circuits or ground states of many body Hamiltonians with polynomial-size gaps, while a shallow network through a restricted Boltzmann machine cannot efficiently represent those states unless the polynomial hierarchy in computational complexity theory collapses.",

TensorFlow uses dataflow graphs to represent computation, shared state, and the operations that mutate that state. It maps the nodes of a dataflow graph across many machines in a cluster, and within a machine across multiple computational devices, including multicore CPUs, general-purpose GPUs, and custom designed ASICs known as Tensor Processing Units (TPUs). This architecture gives flexibility to the application developer: whereas in previous \"parameter server\" designs the management of shared state is built into the system, TensorFlow enables developers to experiment with novel optimizations and training algorithms. TensorFlow supports a variety of applications, with particularly strong support for training and inference on deep neural networks. Several Google services use TensorFlow in production, we have released it as an open-source project, and it has become widely used for machine learning research. In this paper, we describe the TensorFlow dataflow model in contrast to existing systems, and demonstrate the compelling performance that TensorFlow achieves for several real-world applications.",

Activation maps, however, occupy a large memory footprint during both the training and inference step when using mini-batches of inputs. One way to reduce this large memory footprint is to reduce the precision of activations. However, past works have shown that reducing the precision of activations hurts model accuracy. We study schemes to train networks from scratch using reduced-precision activations without hurting accuracy. We reduce the precision of activation maps (along with model parameters) and increase the number of filter maps in a layer, and find that this scheme matches or surpasses the accuracy of the baseline full-precision network. As a result, one can significantly improve the execution efficiency (e.g. reduce dynamic memory footprint, memory bandwidth and computational energy) and speed up the training and inference process with appropriate hardware support. We call our scheme WRPN - wide reduced-precision networks. We report results and show that WRPN scheme is better than previously reported accuracies on ILSVRC-12 dataset while being computationally less expensive compared to previously reported reduced-precision networks.",

In this work, we study rectifier neural networks for image classification from two aspects. First, we propose a Parametric Rectified Linear Unit (PReLU) that generalizes the traditional rectified unit. PReLU improves model fitting with nearly zero extra computational cost and little overfitting risk. Second, we derive a robust initialization method that particularly considers the rectifier nonlinearities. This method enables us to train extremely deep rectified models directly from scratch and to investigate deeper or wider network architectures. Based on our PReLU networks (PReLU-nets), we achieve 4.94% top-5 test error on the ImageNet 2012 classification dataset. This is a 26% relative improvement over the ILSVRC 2014 winner (GoogLeNet, 6.66%).

It is an open question how real spiking neurons produce the kind of powerful neural computation that is possible with deep artificial neural networks, using only so very few spikes to communicate. Building on recent insights in neuroscience, we present an Adapting Spiking Neural Network (ASNN) based on adaptive spiking neurons. These spiking neurons efficiently encode information in spike-trains using a form of Asynchronous Pulsed Sigma-Delta coding while homeostatically optimizing their firing rate. In the proposed paradigm of spiking neuron computation, neural adaptation is tightly coupled to synaptic plasticity, to ensure that downstream neurons can correctly decode upstream spiking neurons. We show that this type of network is inherently able to carry out asynchronous and event-driven neural computation, while performing identical to corresponding artificial neural networks (ANNs). In particular, we show that these adaptive spiking neurons can be drop in replacements for ReLU neurons in standard feedforward ANNs comprised of such units. We demonstrate that this can also be successfully applied to a ReLU based deep convolutional neural network for classifying the MNIST dataset. The ASNN thus outperforms current Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) implementations, while responding (up to) an order of magnitude faster and using an order of magnitude fewer spikes. Additionally, in a streaming setting where frames are continuously classified, we show that the ASNN requires substantially fewer network updates as compared to the corresponding ANN.",

Hypervectors are $D$-dimensional (pseudo)random vectors with independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) components constituting ultra-wide holographic words: $D = 10,000$ bits, for instance. At its very core, HD computing manipulates a set of seed hypervectors to build composite hypervectors representing objects of interest. It demands memory optimizations with simple operations for an e cient hardware realization. In this paper, we propose hardware techniques for optimizations of HD computing, in a synthesizable VHDL library, to enable co-located implementation of both learning and classification tasks on only a small portion of Xilinx(R) UltraScale(TM) FPGAs: (1) We propose simple logical operations to rematerialize the hypervectors on the fly rather than loading them from memory. These operations massively reduce the memory footprint by directly computing the composite hypervectors whose individual seed hypervectors do not need to be stored in memory. (2) Bundling a series of hypervectors over time requires a multibit counter per every hypervector component. We instead propose a binarized back-to-back bundling without requiring any counters. This truly enables on-chip learning with minimal resources as every hypervector component remains binary over the course of training to avoid otherwise multibit component. (3) For every classification event, an associative memory is in charge of finding the closest match between a set of learned hypervectors and a query hypervector by using a distance metric. This operator is proportional to [...]",

The stochasticity of our proposed Ising cell based on SHE induced MTJ switching, can implement the natural annealing process by preventing the system from being stuck in solutions with local minima. Further, by controlling the current through the Heavy-Metal (HM) underlying the MTJ, we can mimic the majority vote function which determines the next state of the individual spins. By solving coupled \\textit{Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert} (LLG) equations, we demonstrate that our Ising cell can be replicated to map certain combinatorial problems. We present results for two representative problems - Maximum-cut and Graph coloring - to illustrate the feasibility of the proposed device-circuit configuration in solving combinatorial problems.

Here, we demonstrate how finite range tunneling can provide considerable computational advantage. For a crafted problem designed to have tall and narrow energy barriers separating local minima, the D-Wave 2X quantum annealer achieves significant runtime advantages relative to Simulated Annealing (SA). For instances with 945 variables, this results in a time-to-99%-success-probability that is $\\sim 10^8$ times faster than SA running on a single processor core. We also compared physical QA with Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC), an algorithm that emulates quantum tunneling on classical processors. We observe a substantial constant overhead against physical QA: D-Wave 2X again runs up to $\\sim 10^8$ times faster than an optimized implementation of QMC on a single core. We note that there exist heuristic classical algorithms that can solve most instances of Chimera structured problems in a timescale comparable to the D-Wave 2X. However, we believe that such solvers will become ineffective for the next generation of annealers currently being designed. To investigate whether finite range tunneling will also confer an advantage for problems of practical interest, we conduct numerical studies on binary optimization problems that cannot yet be represented on quantum hardware. For random instances of the number partitioning problem, we find numerically that QMC, as well as other algorithms designed to simulate QA, scale better than SA. We discuss the implications of these findings for the design of next generation quantum annealers.",

                        "Citation Paper Abstract": "Abstract:Adiabatic Quantum Computing (AQC) is an attractive paradigm for solving hard integer polynomial optimization problems. Available hardware restricts the Hamiltonians to be of a structure that allows only pairwise interactions. This requires that the original optimization problem to be first converted -- from its polynomial form -- to a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) problem, which we frame as a problem in algebraic geometry. Additionally, the hardware graph where such a QUBO-Hamiltonian needs to be embedded -- assigning variables of the problem to the qubits of the physical optimizer -- is not a complete graph, but rather one with limited connectivity. This \"problem graph to hardware graph\" embedding can also be framed as a problem of computing a Groebner basis of a certain specially constructed polynomial ideal. We develop a systematic computational approach to prepare a given polynomial optimization problem for AQC in three steps. The first step reduces an input polynomial optimization problem into a QUBO through the computation of the Groebner basis of a toric ideal generated from the monomials of the input objective function. The second step computes feasible embeddings. The third step computes the spectral gap of the adiabatic Hamiltonian associated to a given embedding. These steps are applicable well beyond the integer polynomial optimization problem. Our paper provides the first general purpose computational procedure that can be used directly as a $translator$ to solve polynomial integer optimization. Alternatively, it can be used as a test-bed (with small size problems) to help design efficient heuristic quantum compilers by studying various choices of reductions and embeddings in a systematic and comprehensive manner. An added benefit of our framework is in designing Ising architectures through the study of $\\mathcal Y-$minor universal graphs.",

Here we show that multiqubit tunneling plays a computational role in a currently available, albeit noisy, programmable quantum annealer. We develop a non-perturbative theory of open quantum dynamics under realistic noise characteristics predicting the rate of many-body dissipative quantum tunneling. We devise a computational primitive with 16 qubits where quantum evolutions enable tunneling to the global minimum while the corresponding classical paths are trapped in a false minimum. Furthermore, we experimentally demonstrate that quantum tunneling can outperform thermal hopping along classical paths for problems with up to 200 qubits containing the computational primitive.

This technique provides a direct means of observing two-qubit dynamics and a probe of the environment coupled to the pair of qubits. Measurements of the tunneling rate as a function of qubit flux bias show a Gaussian line shape that is well matched to theoretical predictions. Moreover, the peak widths indicate that each qubit is coupled to a local environment whose fluctuations are uncorrelated with that of the other qubit.",

This has stimulated recent progress in classical algorithms to simulate quantum circuits. Classical simulations are also necessary to approximate the fidelity of multiqubit quantum computers using cross entropy benchmarking. Here we present numerical results of a classical simulation algorithm to sample universal random circuits, on a single workstation, with more qubits and depth than previously reported. For example, circuits with $5 \\times 9$ qubits of depth 37, $7 \\times 8$ qubits of depth 27, and $10 \\times (\\kappa > 10)$) qubits of depth 19 are all easy to sample. We also show up to what depth the sampling, or estimation of observables, is trivially parallelizable. The algorithm is related to the \"Feynmann path\" method to simulate quantum circuits. For low-depth circuits, the algorithm scales exponentially in the depth times the smaller lateral dimension, or the treewidth, as explained in Boixo et. al., and therefore confirms the bounds in that paper. In particular, circuits with $7 \\times 7$ qubits and depth 40 remain currently out of reach. Follow up work on a supercomputer environment will tighten this bound.",

However, the fidelity of existing quantum computers often sharply decreases as the circuit depth increases. Thus, an ideal quantum circuit simulator on classical computers, especially on high-performance computers, is needed for benchmarking and validation. We design a large-scale simulator of universal random quantum circuits, often called 'quantum supremacy circuits', and implement it on Sunway TaihuLight. The simulator can be used to accomplish the following two tasks: 1) Computing a complete output state-vector; 2) Calculating one or a few amplitudes. We target the simulation of 49-qubit circuits. For task 1), we successfully simulate such a circuit of depth 39, and for task 2) we reach the 55-depth level. To the best of our knowledge, both of the simulation results reach the largest depth for 49-qubit quantum supremacy circuits.",

In particular, we report a decomposition of the Toffoli gate over the set of Clifford and T gates. Our decomposition achieves a total T-depth of 3, thereby providing a 40% reduction over the previously best known decomposition for the Toffoli gate.

Understanding the inner workings of such computational brains is both fascinating basic science that is interesting in its own right - similar to why we study the human brain - and will enable researchers to further improve DNNs. One path to understanding how a neural network functions internally is to study what each of its neurons has learned to detect. One such method is called activation maximization (AM), which synthesizes an input (e.g. an image) that highly activates a neuron. Here we dramatically improve the qualitative state of the art of activation maximization by harnessing a powerful, learned prior: a deep generator network (DGN). The algorithm (1) generates qualitatively state-of-the-art synthetic images that look almost real, (2) reveals the features learned by each neuron in an interpretable way, (3) generalizes well to new datasets and somewhat well to different network architectures without requiring the prior to be relearned, and (4) can be considered as a high-quality generative method (in this case, by generating novel, creative, interesting, recognizable images).",

However, while LSTMs provide exceptional results in practice, the source of their performance and their limitations remain rather poorly understood. Using character-level language models as an interpretable testbed, we aim to bridge this gap by providing an analysis of their representations, predictions and error types. In particular, our experiments reveal the existence of interpretable cells that keep track of long-range dependencies such as line lengths, quotes and brackets. Moreover, our comparative analysis with finite horizon n-gram models traces the source of the LSTM improvements to long-range structural dependencies. Finally, we provide analysis of the remaining errors and suggests areas for further study.",

Our main focus is on optimizing the memory footprint of the resulting reversible networks. This is motivated by the limited availability of qubits for the foreseeable future. We apply three main techniques to keep the number of required qubits small when computing classical, irreversible computations by means of reversible networks: first, wherever possible we allow the compiler to make use of in-place functions to modify some of the variables. Second, an intermediate representation is introduced that allows to trace data dependencies within the program, allowing to clean up qubits early. This realizes an analog to \"garbage collection\" for reversible circuits. Third, we use the concept of so-called pebble games to transform irreversible programs into reversible programs under space constraints, allowing for data to be erased and recomputed if needed.\nWe introduce REVS, a compiler for reversible circuits that can translate a subset of the functional programming language F# into Toffoli networks which can then be further interpreted for instance in LIQui|>, a domain-specific language for quantum computing and which is also embedded into F#. We discuss a number of test cases that illustrate the advantages of our approach including reversible implementations of SHA-2 and other cryptographic hash-functions, reversible integer arithmetic, as well as a test-bench of combinational circuits used in classical circuit synthesis. Compared to Bennett's method, REVS can reduce space complexity by a factor of $4$ or more, while having an only moderate increase in circuit size as well as in the time it takes to compile the reversible networks.",

Our approach is based on Grover and Rudolph's method for preparing coherent versions of efficiently integrable probability distributions. This method is intended for use in quantum walk algorithms with polynomial speedups, whose complexity is usually measured in terms of how many times we have to apply a step of a quantum walk, compared to the number of necessary classical Markov chain steps. We consider a finer notion of complexity including the number of elementary gates it takes to implement each step of the quantum walk with some desired accuracy. The difference in complexity for various implementation approaches is that our method scales linearly in the sparsity parameter and poly-logarithmically with the inverse of the desired precision. The best previously known general methods either scale quadratically in the sparsity parameter, or polynomially in the inverse precision. Our approach is especially relevant for implementing quantum walks corresponding to classical random walks like those used in the classical algorithms for approximating permanents and sampling from binary contingency tables. In those algorithms, the sparsity parameter grows with the problem size, while maintaining high precision is required.",

The method has been first formalized by von Neumann (1951) and has many applications in classical computing. We define a quantum analogue of rejection sampling: given a black box producing a coherent superposition of (possibly unknown) quantum states with some amplitudes, the problem is to prepare a coherent superposition of the same states, albeit with different target amplitudes. The main result of this paper is a tight characterization of the query complexity of this quantum state generation problem. We exhibit an algorithm, which we call quantum rejection sampling, and analyze its cost using semidefinite programming. Our proof of a matching lower bound is based on the automorphism principle which allows to symmetrize any algorithm over the automorphism group of the problem. Our main technical innovation is an extension of the automorphism principle to continuous groups that arise for quantum state generation problems where the oracle encodes unknown quantum states, instead of just classical data. Furthermore, we illustrate how quantum rejection sampling may be used as a primitive in designing quantum algorithms, by providing three different applications. We first show that it was implicitly used in the quantum algorithm for linear systems of equations by Harrow, Hassidim and Lloyd. Secondly, we show that it can be used to speed up the main step in the quantum Metropolis sampling algorithm by Temme et al.. Finally, we derive a new quantum algorithm for the hidden shift problem of an arbitrary Boolean function and relate its query complexity to \"water-filling\" of the Fourier spectrum.",

Such a machine would have a wide range of applications in the simulation of many-body quantum physics, including condensed matter physics, chemistry, and high energy physics. Part of Feynman's challenge was met by Lloyd who showed how to approximately decompose the time-evolution operator of interacting quantum particles into a short sequence of elementary gates, suitable for operation on a quantum computer. However, this left open the problem of how to simulate the equilibrium and static properties of quantum systems. This requires the preparation of ground and Gibbs states on a quantum computer. For classical systems, this problem is solved by the ubiquitous Metropolis algorithm, a method that basically acquired a monopoly for the simulation of interacting particles. Here, we demonstrate how to implement a quantum version of the Metropolis algorithm on a quantum computer. This algorithm permits to sample directly from the eigenstates of the Hamiltonian and thus evades the sign problem present in classical simulations. A small scale implementation of this algorithm can already be achieved with today's technology",

Relatively little attention has been given to using the compiler output to fully control the operations on experimental quantum processors. Bridging this gap, we propose and build a prototype of a flexible control microarchitecture supporting quantum-classical mixed code for a superconducting quantum processor. The microarchitecture is based on three core elements: (i) a codeword-based event control scheme, (ii) queue-based precise event timing control, and (iii) a flexible multilevel instruction decoding mechanism for control. We design a set of quantum microinstructions that allows flexible control of quantum operations with precise timing.

Networks with short average path length, high clustering coefficient, and power-law degree distribution are designed using a growth model that assigns connections between new and existing nodes based on spatial distance as well as degree of existing nodes. The network construction algorithm is scalable to arbitrary levels of network hierarchy and achieves systems with fractal spatial properties and efficient wiring. By modeling the physical size of superconducting optoelectronic neurons, we calculate the area of these networks. A system with 8100 neurons and 330,430 total synapses will fit on a 1\\,cm $\\times$ 1\\,cm die. Systems of millions of neurons with hundreds of millions of synapses will fit on a 300\\,mm wafer. For multi-wafer assemblies, communication at light speed enables a neuronal pool the size of a large data center comprising 100 trillion neurons with coherent oscillations at 1\\,MHz. Assuming a power law frequency distribution, as is necessary for self-organized criticality, we calculate the power consumption of the networks.

Free space path loss, signal absorption, as well as reflections, refractions and diffractions caused by physical objects within the environment highly affect the performance of wireless communications. Currently, such effects are intractable to account for and are treated as probabilistic factors. The paper proposes a radically different approach, enabling deterministic, programmable control over the behavior of the wireless environments. The key-enabler is the so-called HyperSurface tile, a novel class of planar meta-materials which can interact with impinging electromagnetic waves in a controlled manner. The HyperSurface tiles can effectively re-engineer electromagnetic waves, including steering towards any desired direction, full absorption, polarization manipulation and more. Multiple tiles are employed to coat objects such as walls, furniture, overall, any objects in the indoor and outdoor environments. An external software service calculates and deploys the optimal interaction types per tile, to best fit the needs of communicating devices. Evaluation via simulations highlights the potential of the new concept.",

However, the typical shallow SNN architectures have limited capacity for expressing complex representations while training deep SNNs using input spikes has not been successful so far. Diverse methods have been proposed to get around this issue such as converting off-the-shelf trained deep Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) to SNNs. However, the ANN-SNN conversion scheme fails to capture the temporal dynamics of a spiking system. On the other hand, it is still a difficult problem to directly train deep SNNs using input spike events due to the discontinuous, non-differentiable nature of the spike generation function. To overcome this problem, we propose an approximate derivative method that accounts for the leaky behavior of LIF neurons. This method enables training deep convolutional SNNs directly (with input spike events) using spike-based backpropagation. Our experiments show the effectiveness of the proposed spike-based learning on deep networks (VGG and Residual architectures) by achieving the best classification accuracies in MNIST, SVHN and CIFAR-10 datasets compared to other SNNs trained with a spike-based learning. Moreover, we analyze sparse event-based computations to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed SNN training method for inference operation in the spiking domain.",

Modern paradigms are implicitly optimized for it, and numerous guidelines exist to ensure its proper use. Recently, synthetic gradients methods -where the error gradient is only roughly approximated - have garnered interest. These methods not only better portray how biological brains are learning, but also open new computational possibilities, such as updating layers asynchronously. Even so, they have failed to scale past simple tasks like MNIST or CIFAR-10. This is in part due to a lack of standards, leading to ill-suited models and practices forbidding such methods from performing to the best of their abilities. In this work, we focus on direct feedback alignment and present a set of best practices justified by observations of the alignment angles. We characterize a bottleneck effect that prevents alignment in narrow layers, and hypothesize it may explain why feedback alignment methods have yet to scale to large convolutional networks.",

Some of the most promising algorithms for these machines are variational algorithms that employ classical optimization coupled with quantum hardware to evaluate the quality of each candidate solution. Recent work used GRadient Descent Pulse Engineering (GRAPE) to translate quantum programs into highly optimized machine control pulses, resulting in a significant reduction in the execution time of programs. This is critical, as quantum machines can barely support the execution of short programs before failing.\nHowever, GRAPE suffers from high compilation latency, which is untenable in variational algorithms since compilation is interleaved with computation. We propose two strategies for partial compilation, exploiting the structure of variational circuits to pre-compile optimal pulses for specific blocks of gates. Our results indicate significant pulse speedups ranging from 1.5x-3x in typical benchmarks, with only a small fraction of the compilation latency of GRAPE.",

                        "Citation Paper Abstract": "Abstract:Noise is a significant obstacle to quantum computing, and $ZZ$ crosstalk is one of the most destructive types of noise affecting superconducting qubits. Previous approaches to suppressing $ZZ$ crosstalk have mainly relied on specific chip design that can complicate chip fabrication and aggravate decoherence. To some extent, special chip design can be avoided by relying on pulse optimization to suppress $ZZ$ crosstalk. However, existing approaches are non-scalable, as their required time and memory grow exponentially with the number of qubits involved. To address the above problems, we propose a scalable approach by co-optimizing pulses and scheduling. We optimize pulses to offer an ability to suppress $ZZ$ crosstalk surrounding a gate, and then design scheduling strategies to exploit this ability and achieve suppression across the whole circuit. A main advantage of such co-optimization is that it does not require special hardware support. Besides, we implement our approach as a general framework that is compatible with different pulse optimization methods. We have conducted extensive evaluations by simulation and on a real quantum computer. Simulation results show that our proposal can improve the fidelity of quantum computing on $4{\\sim}12$ qubits by up to $81\\times$ ($11\\times$ on average). Ramsey experiments on a real quantum computer also demonstrate that our method can eliminate the effect of $ZZ$ crosstalk to a great extent.",

In recent years, powerful approaches have been developed which focus on optimizing the high-level circuit structure. However, these approaches do not consider and thus cannot optimize for the hardware details of the quantum architecture, which is especially important for near-term devices. To address this point, we present an approach to quantum circuit optimization based on reinforcement learning. We demonstrate how an agent, realized by a deep convolutional neural network, can autonomously learn generic strategies to optimize arbitrary circuits on a specific architecture, where the optimization target can be chosen freely by the user. We demonstrate the feasibility of this approach by training agents on 12-qubit random circuits, where we find on average a depth reduction by 27% and a gate count reduction by 15%. We examine the extrapolation to larger circuits than used for training, and envision how this approach can be utilized for near-term quantum devices.",

The depth of the circuit grows linearly with p times (at worst) the number of constraints. If p is fixed, that is, independent of the input size, the algorithm makes use of efficient classical preprocessing. If p grows with the input size a different strategy is proposed. We study the algorithm as applied to MaxCut on regular graphs and analyze its performance on 2-regular and 3-regular graphs for fixed p. For p = 1, on 3-regular graphs the quantum algorithm always finds a cut that is at least 0.6924 times the size of the optimal cut.",

This application may be facilitated by variational quantum-classical algorithms (VQCAs), although a concern for VQCAs is the large number of measurements needed for convergence, especially for chemical accuracy. Here we introduce a strategy for reducing the number of measurements (i.e., shots) by randomly sampling operators $h_i$ from the overall Hamiltonian $H = \\sum_i c_i h_i$. In particular, we employ weighted sampling, which is important when the $c_i$'s are highly non-uniform, as is typical in chemistry. We integrate this strategy with an adaptive optimizer developed recently by our group to construct an improved optimizer called Rosalin (Random Operator Sampling for Adaptive Learning with Individual Number of shots). Rosalin implements stochastic gradient descent while adapting the shot noise for each partial derivative and randomly assigning the shots amongst the $h_i$ according to a weighted distribution. We implement this and other optimizers to find the ground states of molecules H$_2$, LiH, and BeH$_2$, without and with quantum hardware noise, and Rosalin outperforms other optimizers in most cases.",

For a fixed repressor strength, the noise due to diffusion can be minimized by increasing the number of repressors or by decreasing the rate of the open complex formation. We also show that the effect of spatial fluctuations can be well described by a two-step kinetic scheme, where formation of an encounter complex by diffusion and the subsequent association reaction are treated separately.

To this end, a variety of model compression and acceleration techniques have been developed. As a representative type of model compression and acceleration, knowledge distillation effectively learns a small student model from a large teacher model. It has received rapid increasing attention from the community. This paper provides a comprehensive survey of knowledge distillation from the perspectives of knowledge categories, training schemes, teacher-student architecture, distillation algorithms, performance comparison and applications.

One aspect of the field receiving considerable attention is efficiently executing deep models in resource-constrained environments, such as mobile or embedded devices. This paper focuses on this problem, and proposes two new compression methods, which jointly leverage weight quantization and distillation of larger teacher networks into smaller student networks. The first method we propose is called quantized distillation and leverages distillation during the training process, by incorporating distillation loss, expressed with respect to the teacher, into the training of a student network whose weights are quantized to a limited set of levels. The second method, differentiable quantization, optimizes the location of quantization points through stochastic gradient descent, to better fit the behavior of the teacher model. We validate both methods through experiments on convolutional and recurrent architectures. We show that quantized shallow students can reach similar accuracy levels to full-precision teacher models, while providing order of magnitude compression, and inference speedup that is linear in the depth reduction. In sum, our results enable DNNs for resource-constrained environments to leverage architecture and accuracy advances developed on more powerful devices.",

Careful design of low-level controls has been shown to compensate for the processes which induce hardware errors, leveraging techniques from optimal and robust control. However, these techniques rely heavily on the availability of highly accurate and detailed physical models which generally only achieve sufficient representative fidelity for the most simple operations and generic noise modes. In this work, we use deep reinforcement learning to design a universal set of error-robust quantum logic gates on a superconducting quantum computer, without requiring knowledge of a specific Hamiltonian model of the system, its controls, or its underlying error processes. We experimentally demonstrate that a fully autonomous deep reinforcement learning agent can design single qubit gates up to $3\\times$ faster than default DRAG operations without additional leakage error, and exhibiting robustness against calibration drifts over weeks. We then show that $ZX(-\\pi/2)$ operations implemented using the cross-resonance interaction can outperform hardware default gates by over $2\\times$ and equivalently exhibit superior calibration-free performance up to 25 days post optimization using various metrics. We benchmark the performance of deep reinforcement learning derived gates against other black box optimization techniques, showing that deep reinforcement learning can achieve comparable or marginally superior performance, even with limited hardware access.",

The results show that once the network is well trained, it works for any initial states in the continuous Hilbert space. Thus repeated training for new preparation tasks is avoided.

Different Markovian and non-Markovian environments are compared and efficient optimisation algorithms utilising analytic gradient expressions and quasi-Newton updates are given for both cases. The performance of the algorithms is analysed for a large set of problems in terms of the fidelities attained and the observed convergence behaviour. New notions of success rate and success speed are introduced and density plots are utilised to study the effect of key parameters, such as gate operation times, and random variables, such as the initial fields required to start the iterative algorithm. Core characteristics of the optimal fields are statistically analysed. Substantial differences between Markovian and non-Markovian environments in terms of the possibilities for control and the control mechanisms are uncovered. In particular, in the Markovian case it is found that the optimal fields obtained without considering the environment cannot be improved substantially by taking the environment into account and the fidelities attained are determined mostly by the gate operation time as well as the overall strength of the environmental effects. Computation time is saved if the fields are pre-optimised neglecting decoherence. In the non-Markovian case, on the other hand, substantial improvements in the fidelities are observed when the details of the system-bath coupling are taken into account. In that case, field leakage is shown to be a significant issue which can make high gate fidelities impossible to obtain unless both the system and noise qubits are fully controlled.",

Due to its fundamental importance, a plethora of quantum compilers has been designed in past years. However, there are several caveats to current protocols, which are low optimality, high inference time, limited scalability, and lack of universality. To compensate for these defects, here we devise an efficient and practical quantum compiler assisted by advanced deep reinforcement learning (RL) techniques, i.e., data generation, deep Q-learning, and AQ* search. In this way, our protocol is compatible with various quantum machines and can be used to compile multi-qubit operators. We systematically evaluate the performance of our proposal in compiling quantum operators with both inverse-closed and inverse-free universal basis sets. In the task of single-qubit operator compiling, our proposal outperforms other RL-based quantum compilers in the measure of compiling sequence length and inference time. Meanwhile, the output solution is near-optimal, guaranteed by the Solovay-Kitaev theorem. Notably, for the inverse-free universal basis set, the achieved sequence length complexity is comparable with the inverse-based setting and dramatically advances previous methods. These empirical results contribute to improving the inverse-free Solovay-Kitaev theorem. In addition, for the first time, we demonstrate how to leverage RL-based quantum compilers to accomplish two-qubit operator compiling. The achieved results open an avenue for integrating RL with quantum compiling to unify efficiency and practicality and thus facilitate the exploration of quantum advantages.",

It is a crucial stage for the running of quantum algorithms on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. However, the space for structure exploration of quantum circuit is enormous, resulting in the requirement of human expertise, hundreds of experimentations or modifications from existing quantum circuits. In this paper, we propose a variational quantum compiling (VQC) algorithm based on reinforcement learning (RL), in order to automatically design the structure of quantum circuit for VQC with no human intervention. An agent is trained to sequentially select quantum gates from the native gate alphabet and the qubits they act on by double Q-learning with \\epsilon-greedy exploration strategy and experience replay. At first, the agent randomly explores a number of quantum circuits with different structures, and then iteratively discovers structures with higher performance on the learning task. Simulation results show that the proposed method can make exact compilations with less quantum gates compared to previous VQC algorithms. It can reduce the errors of quantum algorithms due to decoherence process and gate noise in NISQ devices, and enable quantum algorithms especially for complex algorithms to be executed within coherence time.",

It generates near-optimal gate sequences with given accuracy and is generally applicable to various scenarios, independent of the hardware-feasible universal set and free from using ancillary qubits. For concreteness, we apply this algorithm to the case of topological compiling of Fibonacci anyons and obtain near-optimal braiding sequences for arbitrary single-qubit unitaries.

The general problem of quantum compiling is to approximate any unitary transformation that describes the quantum computation, as a sequence of elements selected from a finite base of universal quantum gates. The existence of an approximating sequence of one qubit quantum gates is guaranteed by the Solovay-Kitaev theorem, which implies sub-optimal algorithms to establish it explicitly. Since a unitary transformation may require significantly different gate sequences, depending on the base considered, such a problem is of great complexity and does not admit an efficient approximating algorithm. Therefore, traditional approaches are time-consuming tasks, unsuitable to be employed during quantum computation. We exploit the deep reinforcement learning method as an alternative strategy, which has a significantly different trade-off between search time and exploitation time. Deep reinforcement learning allows creating single-qubit operations in real time, after an arbitrary long training period during which a strategy for creating sequences to approximate unitary operators is built. The deep reinforcement learning based compiling method allows for fast computation times, which could in principle be exploited for real-time quantum compiling.",

                        "Citation Paper Abstract": "Abstract:Dynamic treatment recommendation systems based on large-scale electronic health records (EHRs) become a key to successfully improve practical clinical outcomes. Prior relevant studies recommend treatments either use supervised learning (e.g. matching the indicator signal which denotes doctor prescriptions), or reinforcement learning (e.g. maximizing evaluation signal which indicates cumulative reward from survival rates). However, none of these studies have considered to combine the benefits of supervised learning and reinforcement learning. In this paper, we propose Supervised Reinforcement Learning with Recurrent Neural Network (SRL-RNN), which fuses them into a synergistic learning framework. Specifically, SRL-RNN applies an off-policy actor-critic framework to handle complex relations among multiple medications, diseases and individual characteristics. The \"actor\" in the framework is adjusted by both the indicator signal and evaluation signal to ensure effective prescription and low mortality. RNN is further utilized to solve the Partially-Observed Markov Decision Process (POMDP) problem due to the lack of fully observed states in real world applications. Experiments on the publicly real-world dataset, i.e., MIMIC-3, illustrate that our model can reduce the estimated mortality, while providing promising accuracy in matching doctors' prescriptions.",

Recent works have shown that small distance quantum error correction codes can be efficiently decoded by employing machine learning techniques based on neural networks (NN). Various NN-based decoders have been proposed to enhance the decoding performance and the decoding time. Their implementation differs in how the decoding is performed, at logical or physical level, as well as in several neural network related parameters. In this work, we implement and compare two NN-based decoders, a low level decoder and a high level decoder, and study how different NN parameters affect their decoding performance and execution time. Crucial parameters such as the size of the training dataset, the structure and the type of the neural network, and the learning rate used during training are discussed. After performing this comparison, we conclude that the high level decoder based on a Recurrent NN shows a better balance between decoding performance and execution time and it is much easier to train. We then test its decoding performance for different code distances, probability datasets and under the depolarizing and circuit error models.",

Here we experimentally implement its smallest viable instance, capable of repeatedly detecting any single error using seven superconducting qubits, four data qubits and three ancilla qubits. Using high-fidelity ancilla-based stabilizer measurements we initialize the cardinal states of the encoded logical qubit with an average logical fidelity of 96.1%. We then repeatedly check for errors using the stabilizer readout and observe that the logical quantum state is preserved with a lifetime and coherence time longer than those of any of the constituent qubits when no errors are detected.

Here we show the encoding and syndrome measurement of a fault-tolerant logical qubit via an error detection protocol on four physical qubits, represented by trapped atomic ions.

However, any quantum algorithm must ultimately operate on error-protected logical qubits encoded in high-dimensional systems. Typically, logical qubits are encoded in multiple two-level systems, but entangling gates operating on such qubits are highly complex and have not yet been demonstrated. Here, we realize a controlled NOT (CNOT) gate between two multiphoton qubits in two microwave cavities. In this approach, we encode a qubit in the high-dimensional space of a single cavity mode, rather than in multiple two-level systems. We couple two such encoded qubits together through a transmon, which is driven by an RF pump to apply the gate within 190 ns. This is two orders of magnitude shorter than the decoherence time of the transmon, enabling a high-fidelity gate operation. These results are an important step towards universal algorithms on error-corrected logical qubits.",

This framework naturally captures the error structure that arises in certain physical systems for quantum computing, such as photonics. FBQC can offer significant architectural simplifications, enabling hardware made up of many identical modules, requiring an extremely low depth of operations on each physical qubit and reducing classical processing requirements. We present two pedagogical examples of fault-tolerant schemes constructed in this framework and numerically evaluate their threshold under a hardware agnostic fusion error model including both erasure and Pauli error. We also study an error model of linear optical quantum computing with probabilistic fusion and photon loss. In FBQC the non-determinism of fusion is directly dealt with by the quantum error correction protocol, along with other errors. We find that tailoring the fault-tolerance framework to the physical system allows the scheme to have a higher threshold than schemes reported in literature. We present a ballistic scheme which can tolerate a 10.4% probability of suffering photon loss in each fusion.",

Here, we demonstrate a spectral analysis technique for resolving time dependence in quantum processors. Our method is fast, simple, and statistically sound. It can be applied to time-series data from any quantum processor experiment. We use data from simulations and trapped-ion qubit experiments to show how our method can resolve time dependence when applied to popular characterization protocols, including randomized benchmarking, gate set tomography, and Ramsey spectroscopy.

Most notably, we introduce a new environment called CoinRun, designed as a benchmark for generalization in RL. Using CoinRun, we find that agents overfit to surprisingly large training sets.

We propose a quantum architecture search framework with the power of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to address this challenge. In the proposed framework, the DRL agent can only access the Pauli-$X$, $Y$, $Z$ expectation values and a predefined set of quantum operations for learning the target quantum state, and is optimized by the advantage actor-critic (A2C) and proximal policy optimization (PPO) algorithms. We demonstrate a successful generation of quantum gate sequences for multi-qubit GHZ states without encoding any knowledge of quantum physics in the agent. The design of our framework is rather general and can be employed with other DRL architectures or optimization methods to study gate synthesis and compilation for many quantum states.",

They harness non-local regularities of noisy control trajectories and facilitate transfer learning between tasks. To leverage these powerful capabilities for quantum control optimization, we propose a new control framework to simultaneously optimize the speed and fidelity of quantum computation against both leakage and stochastic control errors. For a broad family of two-qubit unitary gates that are important for quantum simulation of many-electron systems, we improve the control robustness by adding control noise into training environments for reinforcement learning agents trained with trusted-region-policy-optimization. The agent control solutions demonstrate a two-order-of-magnitude reduction in average-gate-error over baseline stochastic-gradient-descent solutions and up to a one-order-of-magnitude reduction in gate time from optimal gate synthesis counterparts.",

Yet, preparing states quickly and with high fidelity remains a formidable challenge. In this work we implement cutting-edge Reinforcement Learning (RL) techniques and show that their performance is comparable to optimal control methods in the task of finding short, high-fidelity driving protocol from an initial to a target state in non-integrable many-body quantum systems of interacting qubits. RL methods learn about the underlying physical system solely through a single scalar reward (the fidelity of the resulting state) calculated from numerical simulations of the physical system. We further show that quantum state manipulation, viewed as an optimization problem, exhibits a spin-glass-like phase transition in the space of protocols as a function of the protocol duration. Our RL-aided approach helps identify variational protocols with nearly optimal fidelity, even in the glassy phase, where optimal state manipulation is exponentially hard. This study highlights the potential usefulness of RL for applications in out-of-equilibrium quantum physics.",

Our results show that our proposed decoding method achieves $\\sim10 \\times$ and $\\sim2 \\times$ higher values of pseudo-threshold and threshold respectively, than for MWPM. We show that usage of more sophisticated ML models with higher training/testing time, do not provide significant improvement in the decoder performance.

MC systems are expected to enable new revolutionary applications such as sensing of target substances in biotechnology, smart drug delivery in medicine, and monitoring of oil pipelines or chemical reactors in industrial settings. As for any other kind of communication, simple yet sufficiently accurate channel models are needed for the design, analysis, and efficient operation of MC systems. In this paper, we provide a tutorial review on mathematical channel modeling for diffusive MC systems. The considered end-to-end MC channel models incorporate the effects of the release mechanism, the MC environment, and the reception mechanism on the observed information molecules. Thereby, the various existing models for the different components of an MC system are presented under a common framework and the underlying biological, chemical, and physical phenomena are discussed. Deterministic models characterizing the expected number of molecules observed at the receiver and statistical models characterizing the actual number of observed molecules are developed. In addition, we provide channel models for time-varying MC systems with moving transmitters and receivers, which are relevant for advanced applications such as smart drug delivery with mobile nanomachines. For complex scenarios, where simple MC channel models cannot be obtained from first principles, we investigate simulation-driven and experimentally-driven channel models. Finally, we provide a detailed discussion of potential challenges, open research problems, and future directions in channel modeling for diffusive MC systems.",

The evolution of the quantum state is governed by a time-dependent Hamiltonian that interpolates between an initial Hamiltonian, whose ground state is easy to construct, and a final Hamiltonian, whose ground state encodes the satisfying assignment. To ensure that the system evolves to the desired final ground state, the evolution time must be big enough. The time required depends on the minimum energy difference between the two lowest states of the interpolating Hamiltonian. We are unable to estimate this gap in general.

Our experiment uses a colloidal particle in a time-dependent, virtual potential created by a feedback trap to implement Landauer's erasure operation. In a control experiment, similar manipulations that do not reduce the number of system states can be done reversibly. Erasing information thus requires work. In individual cycles, the work to erase can be below the Landauer limit, consistent with the Jarzynski equality.",

However, practical physical computers, such as modern digital computers or biochemical systems, are subject to constraints that make them inefficient -- irreversibly dissipating significant energy. Recent results show that the dissipation in such systems is bounded by the nonreciprocity of the embedded computation. We investigate the consequences of this bound for different types of memory, showing that different memory devices are better suited for different computations. This correspondence comes from the time-reversal symmetries of the memory, which depend on whether information is stored positionally or magnetically. This establishes that the time symmetries of the memory device play an essential roll in determining energetics. The energetic consequences of time symmetries are particularly pronounced in nearly deterministic computations, where the cost of computing diverges as minus log of the error rate. We identify the coefficient of that divergence as the dissipation divergence. We find that the dissipation divergence may be zero for a computation when implemented in one type of memory while it's maximal when implemented with another. Given flexibility in the type of memory, the dissipation divergence is bounded below by the average state compression of the computation. Moreover, we show how to explicitly construct the memory to achieve this minimal dissipation. As a result, we find that logically reversible computations are indeed thermodynamically efficient, but logical irreversibility comes at a much higher cost than previously anticipated.",

In the absence of noise (zero-temperature limit), the dynamics show the emergence of a new bistable phase where coherent and incoherent limit cycles coexist. At finite temperatures, we develop a stochastic thermodynamic framework based on the dynamics of a charged particle in a magnetic field to identify physically meaningful heat and work. The stochastic system no longer exhibits the bistable phase but the thermodynamic observables, such as work, exhibit bistability in the temporally metastable regime. We demonstrate that the inertial-like Stuart-Landau dimer operates like a machine, reliably outputting the most work when the oscillators coherently synchronize and unreliable with minimum work output when the oscillators are incoherent. Overall, our results show the importance of coherent synchronization within the working substance in the operation of a thermal machine.",

This paper presents a new type of photonic accelerator based on coherent detection that is scalable to large ($N \\gtrsim 10^6$) networks and can be operated at high (GHz) speeds and very low (sub-aJ) energies per multiply-and-accumulate (MAC), using the massive spatial multiplexing enabled by standard free-space optical components. In contrast to previous approaches, both weights and inputs are optically encoded so that the network can be reprogrammed and trained on the fly. Simulations of the network using models for digit- and image-classification reveal a \"standard quantum limit\" for optical neural networks, set by photodetector shot noise. This bound, which can be as low as 50 zJ/MAC, suggests performance below the thermodynamic (Landauer) limit for digital irreversible computation is theoretically possible in this device. The proposed accelerator can implement both fully-connected and convolutional networks. We also present a scheme for back-propagation and training that can be performed in the same hardware.

However, we demonstrate that the high-reliability limit is subject to a fundamental error-energy-efficiency tradeoff that arises from time-symmetric control: Requiring a low probability of error causes energy consumption to diverge as logarithm of the inverse error rate for nonreciprocal logical transitions. The reciprocity (self-invertibility) of a computation is a stricter condition for thermodynamic efficiency than logical reversibility (invertibility), the latter being the root of Landauer's work bound on erasing information. Beyond engineered computation, the results identify a generic error-dissipation tradeoff in steady-state transformations of genetic information carried out by biological organisms. The lesson is that computation under time-symmetric control cannot reach, and is often far above, the Landauer limit. In this way, time-asymmetry becomes a design principle for thermodynamically efficient computing.",

However, this lower bound is achievable only for quasistatic, near-equilibrium computations -- that is, only over infinite time. In practice, information processing takes place in finite time, resulting in dissipation and potentially unreliable logical outcomes. For overdamped Langevin dynamics, we show that counterdiabatic potentials can be crafted to guide systems rapidly and accurately along desired computational paths, providing shortcuts that allows for the precise design of finite-time computations. Such shortcuts require additional work, beyond Landauer's bound, that is irretrievably dissipated into the environment. We show that this dissipated work is proportional to the computation rate as well as the square of the information-storing system's length scale. As a paradigmatic example, we design shortcuts to erase a bit of information metastably stored in a double-well potential. Though dissipated work generally increases with erasure fidelity, we show that it is possible perform perfect erasure in finite time with finite work. We also show that the robustness of information storage affects the energetic cost of erasure---specifically, the dissipated work scales as the information lifetime of the bistable system. Our analysis exposes a rich and nuanced relationship between work, speed, size of the information-bearing degrees of freedom, storage robustness, and the difference between initial and final informational statistics.",

The idea is to redefine the system and environment such that the effective, redefined system is again coupled weakly to Markovian residual baths and thus, allows to derive a consistent thermodynamic framework for this new system-environment partition. To achieve this goal we make use of the reaction coordinate mapping, which is a general method in the sense that it can be applied to an arbitrary (quantum or classical and even time-dependent) system coupled linearly to an arbitrary number of harmonic oscillator reservoirs. The core of the method relies on an appropriate identification of a part of the environment (the reaction coordinate), which is subsequently included as a part of the system. We demonstrate the power of this concept by showing that non-Markovian effects can significantly enhance the steady state efficiency of a three-level-maser heat engine, even in the regime of weak system-bath coupling. Furthermore, we show for a single electron transistor coupled to vibrations that our method allows one to justify master equations derived in a polaron transformed reference frame.",

These are signatures of a refined suite of time-reversal symmetries in distinct functional classes of microscopic trajectories. As a consequence, we introduce a broad family of conditional fluctuation theorems that the component work distributions must satisfy. Since they identify entropy production, the component work distributions encode both the frequency of various mechanisms of success and failure during computing, as well giving improved estimates of the total irreversibly-dissipated heat. This new diagnostic tool provides strong evidence that thermodynamic computing at the nanoscale can be constructively harnessed. We experimentally verify this functional decomposition and the new class of fluctuation theorems by measuring transitions between flux states in a superconducting circuit.",

Reflecting this, a growing body of results embraces rate equations as the underlying mechanics of thermodynamic computation and biological information processing. Strictly applying the implied continuous-time Markov chains, however, excludes a universe of natural computing. We show that expanding the toolset to continuous-time hidden Markov chains substantially removes the constraints. The general point is made concrete by our analyzing two eminently-useful computations that are impossible to describe with a set of rate equations over the memory states. We design and analyze a thermodynamically-costless bit flip, providing a first counterexample to rate-equation modeling. We generalize this to a costless Fredkin gate---a key operation in reversible computing that is computation universal. Going beyond rate-equation dynamics is not only possible, but necessary if stochastic thermodynamics is to become part of the paradigm for physical information processing.",

This requires practical and relevant benchmarks for new software tools to be empirically evaluated and compared to the current state of the art. Although benchmarks for specific design tasks are commonly available, the demand for an overarching cross-level benchmark suite has not yet been fully met and there is no mutual consolidation in how quantum software tools are evaluated thus far. In this work, we propose the MQT Bench benchmark suite (as part of the Munich Quantum Toolkit, MQT) based on four core traits: (1) cross-level support for different abstraction levels, (2) accessibility via an easy-to-use web interface (this https URL) and a Python package, (3) provision of a broad selection of benchmarks to facilitate generalizability, as well as (4) extendability to future algorithms, gate-sets, and hardware architectures. By comprising more than 70,000 benchmark circuits ranging from 2 to 130 qubits on four abstraction levels, MQT Bench presents a first step towards benchmarking different abstraction levels with a single benchmark suite to increase comparability, reproducibility, and transparency.",

They have been shown to be effective in special-purpose accelerators for a limited set of neural network applications.\nWe present the Programmable Ultra-efficient Memristor-based Accelerator (PUMA) which enhances memristor crossbars with general purpose execution units to enable the acceleration of a wide variety of Machine Learning (ML) inference workloads. PUMA's microarchitecture techniques exposed through a specialized Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) retain the efficiency of in-memory computing and analog circuitry, without compromising programmability.\nWe also present the PUMA compiler which translates high-level code to PUMA ISA. The compiler partitions the computational graph and optimizes instruction scheduling and register allocation to generate code for large and complex workloads to run on thousands of spatial cores.\nWe have developed a detailed architecture simulator that incorporates the functionality, timing, and power models of PUMA's components to evaluate performance and energy consumption. A PUMA accelerator running at 1 GHz can reach area and power efficiency of $577~GOPS/s/mm^2$ and $837~GOPS/s/W$, respectively. Our evaluation of diverse ML applications from image recognition, machine translation, and language modelling (5M-800M synapses) shows that PUMA achieves up to $2,446\\times$ energy and $66\\times$ latency improvement for inference compared to state-of-the-art GPUs. Compared to an application-specific memristor-based accelerator, PUMA incurs small energy overheads at similar inference latency and added programmability.",

We use the length of the activity vector to represent the probability that the entity exists and its orientation to represent the instantiation parameters. Active capsules at one level make predictions, via transformation matrices, for the instantiation parameters of higher-level capsules. When multiple predictions agree, a higher level capsule becomes active. We show that a discrimininatively trained, multi-layer capsule system achieves state-of-the-art performance on MNIST and is considerably better than a convolutional net at recognizing highly overlapping digits. To achieve these results we use an iterative routing-by-agreement mechanism: A lower-level capsule prefers to send its output to higher level capsules whose activity vectors have a big scalar product with the prediction coming from the lower-level capsule.",

Due to the weak nonlinearities in most integrated photonic platforms, realizing optical nonlinear functions typically requires large driving energies in the picojoules level or beyond, thus imposing a barrier for most applications. Here, we tackle this challenge and demonstrate an integrated nonlinear splitter device in lithium niobate nano-waveguides by simultaneous engineering of the dispersion and quasi-phase matching. We achieve non-resonant all-optical switching with ultra-low energies down to tens of femtojoules, a near instantaneous switching time of 18 fs, and a large extinction ratio of more than 5 dB. Our nonlinear splitter simultaneously realizes switch-on and -off operations and features a state-of-the-art switching energy-time product as low as $1.4 \\times10^{-27}$ J$\\cdot$s. We also show a path toward attojoule level all-optical switching by further optimizing the device geometry.

Quantum phenomena prove to be attractive for physical RNGs due to their fundamental randomness and immunity to attack [1]- [5]. Optical parametric down conversion is an essential element in most quantum optical experiments including optical squeezing [9], and generation of entangled photons [10]. In an optical parametric oscillator (OPO), photons generated through spontaneous down conversion of the pump initiate the oscillation in the absence of other inputs [11, 12]. This quantum process is the dominant effect during the oscillation build-up, leading to selection of one of the two possible phase states above threshold in a degenerate OPO [13]. Building on this, we demonstrate a novel all-optical quantum RNG in which the photodetection is not a part of the random process, and no post processing is required for the generated bit sequence. We implement a synchronously pumped twin degenerate OPO, which comprises two identical independent OPOs in a single cavity, and measure the relative phase states of the OPO outputs above threshold as a bit value. We show that the outcome is statistically random with 99% confidence. With the use of micro- and nanoscale OPO resonators, this technique offers a promise for simple, robust, and high-speed on-chip all-optical quantum random number generators.",

The helical modulation induces an artificial gauge field and leads to the trivial-to-topological transition. The quasienergy spectrum shows the existence of topological edge states corresponding to real-space Chern number 1. We study the propagation of light along the outer edges of the fractal lattice and find that wavepackets move along the edges without penetrating into the bulk or backscattering even in the presence of disorder. In a similar vein, we find that the inner edges of the fractal lattice also exhibit robust transport when the fractal is of sufficiently high generation. Finally, we find topological edge-states that span the circumference of a hybrid half-fractal half-honeycomb lattice, passing from the edge of the honeycomb lattice to the edge of the fractal structure virtually without scattering, despite the transition from two-dimensions to a fractal dimension. Our system offers a realizable experimental platform to study topological fractals and provides new directions for exploring topological physics.",

So far no efficient classical and quantum algorithm is known for these problems, and intensive research is focused on creating physical systems - Ising machines - capable of finding the absolute or approximate ground states of the Ising Hamiltonian [2-6]. Here we report a novel Ising machine using a network of degenerate optical parametric oscillators (OPOs). Spins are represented with above-threshold binary phases of the OPOs and the Ising couplings are realized by mutual injections [7]. The network is implemented in a single OPO ring cavity with multiple trains of femtosecond pulses and configurable mutual couplings, and operates at room temperature. We programed the smallest non-deterministic polynomial time (NP)- hard Ising problem on the machine, and in 1000 runs of the machine no computational error was detected.",

The robustness of these states presents opportunities to design technologies that are tolerant to fabrication errors and resilient to environmental fluctuations. While most topological phases rely on conservative, or Hermitian, couplings, recent theoretical efforts have combined conservative and dissipative couplings to propose new topological phases for ultracold atoms and for photonics. However, the topological phases that arise due to purely dissipative couplings remain largely unexplored. Here we realize dissipatively coupled versions of two prominent topological models, the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model and the Harper-Hofstadter (HH) model, in the synthetic dimensions of a time-multiplexed photonic resonator network. We observe the topological edge state of the SSH and HH models, measure the SSH model's band structure, and induce a topological phase transition between the SSH model's trivial and topological phases. In stark contrast with conservatively coupled topological phases, the topological phases of our network arise from bands of dissipation rates that possess nontrivial topological invariants, and the edge states of these topological phases exhibit isolated dissipation rates that occur in the gaps between the bulk dissipation bands. Our results showcase the ability of dissipative couplings to enable time-reversal symmetry broken topological phases with nonzero Chern numbers, which have proven challenging to realize in the optical domain. Moreover, our time-multiplexed network, with its ability to implement multiple synthetic dimensions, dynamic and inhomogeneous couplings, and time-reversal symmetry breaking synthetic gauge fields, offers a flexible and scalable architecture for future work in synthetic dimensions.",

Recent work has predicted that coupling between noisy environments and disordered systems, in which coherent transport has been arrested due to localization effects, could actually enhance transport. Photonic integrated circuits are promising platforms for studying such effects, with a central goal being the development of large systems providing low-loss, high-fidelity control over all parameters of the transport problem. Here, we fully map the role of disorder in quantum transport using a nanophotonic processor consisting of a mesh of 88 generalized beamsplitters programmable on microsecond timescales. Over 64,400 transport experiments, we observe several distinct transport regimes, including environment-assisted quantum transport and the ''quantum Goldilocks'' regime in strong, statically disordered discrete-time systems. Low loss and high-fidelity programmable transformations make this nanophotonic processor a promising platform for many-boson quantum simulation experiments.",

This approach appears particularly promising for Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). In this work, we present a new architecture for implementing an Efficient Unitary Neural Network (EUNNs); its main advantages can be summarized as follows. Firstly, the representation capacity of the unitary space in an EUNN is fully tunable, ranging from a subspace of SU(N) to the entire unitary space. Secondly, the computational complexity for training an EUNN is merely $\\mathcal{O}(1)$ per parameter. Finally, we test the performance of EUNNs on the standard copying task, the pixel-permuted MNIST digit recognition benchmark as well as the Speech Prediction Test (TIMIT). We find that our architecture significantly outperforms both other state-of-the-art unitary RNNs and the LSTM architecture, in terms of the final performance and/or the wall-clock training speed. EUNNs are thus promising alternatives to RNNs and LSTMs for a wide variety of applications.",

Here, we show that it is possible to load an N-dimensional vector with a quantum circuit with polylogarithmic depth and entangled information in ancillary qubits. Results show that we can efficiently load data in quantum devices using a divide-and-conquer strategy to exchange computational time for space. We demonstrate a proof of concept on a real quantum device and present two applications for quantum machine learning.

While the rectangular mesh is favored for its compactness and uniformity, its geometry resists conventional self-configuration approaches, which are essential to programming large meshes in the presence of fabrication error. Here, we present a new configuration algorithm, related to the $2\\times 2$ block decomposition of a unitary matrix, that overcomes this limitation. Our proposed algorithm is robust to errors, requires no prior knowledge of the process variations, and relies only on external sources and detectors. We show that self-configuration using this technique reduces the effect of fabrication errors by the same quadratic factor observed in triangular meshes. This relaxes a significant limit to the size of multiport interferometers, removing a major roadblock to the scaling of optical quantum and machine-learning hardware.",

The most efficient and well-entrenched method to train such networks is backpropagation, or reverse-mode automatic differentiation. To counter an exponentially increasing energy budget in the artificial intelligence sector, there has been recent interest in analog implementations of neural networks, specifically nanophotonic neural networks for which no analog backpropagation demonstration exists. We design mass-manufacturable silicon photonic neural networks that alternately cascade our custom designed \"photonic mesh\" accelerator with digitally implemented nonlinearities. These reconfigurable photonic meshes program computationally intensive arbitrary matrix multiplication by setting physical voltages that tune the interference of optically encoded input data propagating through integrated Mach-Zehnder interferometer networks. Here, using our packaged photonic chip, we demonstrate in situ backpropagation for the first time to solve classification tasks and evaluate a new protocol to keep the entire gradient measurement and update of physical device voltages in the analog domain, improving on past theoretical proposals. Our method is made possible by introducing three changes to typical photonic meshes: (1) measurements at optical \"grating tap\" monitors, (2) bidirectional optical signal propagation automated by fiber switch, and (3) universal generation and readout of optical amplitude and phase. After training, our classification achieves accuracies similar to digital equivalents even in presence of systematic error. Our findings suggest a new training paradigm for photonics-accelerated artificial intelligence based entirely on a physical analog of the popular backpropagation technique.",

To enable low-latency inference on resource-constrained hardware platforms, we propose to design Hardware-Aware Transformers (HAT) with neural architecture search. We first construct a large design space with $\\textit{arbitrary encoder-decoder attention}$ and $\\textit{heterogeneous layers}$. Then we train a $\\textit{SuperTransformer}$ that covers all candidates in the design space, and efficiently produces many $\\textit{SubTransformers}$ with weight sharing. Finally, we perform an evolutionary search with a hardware latency constraint to find a specialized $\\textit{SubTransformer}$ dedicated to run fast on the target hardware. Extensive experiments on four machine translation tasks demonstrate that HAT can discover efficient models for different hardware (CPU, GPU, IoT device). When running WMT'14 translation task on Raspberry Pi-4, HAT can achieve $\\textbf{3}\\times$ speedup, $\\textbf{3.7}\\times$ smaller size over baseline Transformer; $\\textbf{2.7}\\times$ speedup, $\\textbf{3.6}\\times$ smaller size over Evolved Transformer with $\\textbf{12,041}\\times$ less search cost and no performance loss.

However, its memory and computational costs grow quadratically with the input size. Such growth prohibits its application on high-resolution inputs. To remedy this drawback, this paper proposes a novel efficient attention mechanism equivalent to dot-product attention but with substantially less memory and computational costs. Its resource efficiency allows more widespread and flexible integration of attention modules into a network, which leads to better accuracies. Empirical evaluations demonstrated the effectiveness of its advantages. Efficient attention modules brought significant performance boosts to object detectors and instance segmenters on MS-COCO 2017. Further, the resource efficiency democratizes attention to complex models, where high costs prohibit the use of dot-product attention. As an exemplar, a model with efficient attention achieved state-of-the-art accuracies for stereo depth estimation on the Scene Flow dataset. Code is available at this https URL.",

In this work, we provide a comprehensive study of generalization performance in QML after training on a limited number $N$ of training data points. We show that the generalization error of a quantum machine learning model with $T$ trainable gates scales at worst as $\\sqrt{T/N}$. When only $K \\ll T$ gates have undergone substantial change in the optimization process, we prove that the generalization error improves to $\\sqrt{K / N}$. Our results imply that the compiling of unitaries into a polynomial number of native gates, a crucial application for the quantum computing industry that typically uses exponential-size training data, can be sped up significantly. We also show that classification of quantum states across a phase transition with a quantum convolutional neural network requires only a very small training data set. Other potential applications include learning quantum error correcting codes or quantum dynamical simulation. Our work injects new hope into the field of QML, as good generalization is guaranteed from few training data.",

As an application, our method can solve the quantum state-generation problem in a single shot: it only requires a one-shot optimization to generate a model that outputs the desired control sequence for arbitrary target state.

This allows us to perform quantum RL on the MiniGrid environment with 147-dimensional inputs. We demonstrate the quantum advantage of parameter saving using the amplitude encoding.

First, free energy-based Q-learning is studied for discrete action spaces, but continuous state spaces and the impact of experience replay on sample efficiency is assessed. In a second step, a hybrid actor-critic scheme for continuous state-action spaces is developed based on the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient algorithm combining a classical actor network with a QBM-based critic. The results obtained with quantum annealing, both simulated and with D-Wave quantum annealing hardware, are discussed, and the performance is compared to classical reinforcement learning methods. The environments used throughout represent existing particle accelerator beam lines at the European Organisation for Nuclear Research (CERN).

In this paper, we provide concrete numerical evidence that the sample efficiency (the speed of convergence) of quantum RL could be better than that of classical RL, and for achieving comparable learning performance, quantum RL could use much (at least one order of magnitude) fewer trainable parameters than classical RL. Specifically, we employ the popular benchmarking environments of RL in the OpenAI Gym, and show that our quantum RL agent converges faster than classical fully-connected neural networks (FCNs) in the tasks of CartPole and Acrobot under the same optimization process. We also successfully train the first quantum RL agent that can complete the task of LunarLander in the OpenAI Gym. Our quantum RL agent only requires a single-qubit-based variational quantum circuit without entangling gates, followed by a classical neural network (NN) to post-process the measurement output.

It is the case for the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) in the limit of large circuit depth, which aims to solve quadratic unconstrained binary optimization problems. Hence, the expected final state for these algorithms is either a product state or a low-entangled superposition involving a few bitstrings. What happens in between the initial $N$-qubit product state $\\vert 0\\rangle^{\\otimes N}$ and the final one regarding entanglement? Here, we consider the QAOA algorithm for solving the paradigmatic Max-Cut problem on different types of graphs. We study the entanglement growth and spread resulting from randomized and optimized QAOA circuits and find that there is a volume-law entanglement barrier between the initial and final states. We also investigate the entanglement spectrum in connection with random matrix theory. In addition, we compare the entanglement production with a quantum annealing protocol aiming to solve the same Max-Cut problems. Finally, we discuss the implications of our results for the simulation of QAOA circuits with tensor network-based methods relying on low-entanglement for efficiency, such as matrix product states.",

Although the unmatched expressiveness of the many layers can be highly desirable at test time, training very deep networks comes with its own set of challenges. The gradients can vanish, the forward flow often diminishes, and the training time can be painfully slow. To address these problems, we propose stochastic depth, a training procedure that enables the seemingly contradictory setup to train short networks and use deep networks at test time. We start with very deep networks but during training, for each mini-batch, randomly drop a subset of layers and bypass them with the identity function. This simple approach complements the recent success of residual networks. It reduces training time substantially and improves the test error significantly on almost all data sets that we used for evaluation. With stochastic depth we can increase the depth of residual networks even beyond 1200 layers and still yield meaningful improvements in test error (4.91% on CIFAR-10).",

This accuracy is achieved by training the neural network to learn only the magnetic near-field distributions of a system and to use a discrete formalism of Maxwell's equations in two ways: as physical constraints in the loss function and as a means to calculate the electric fields from the magnetic fields. As a model system, we construct a surrogate simulator for periodic silicon nanostructure arrays and show that the high speed simulator can be directly and effectively used in the local and global freeform optimization of metagratings.

These data-driven models are trained to predict a subspace within which the solution of the frequency-domain Maxwell's equations lie. This subspace can then be used for augmenting the Krylov subspace generated during the GMRES iterations.

Nevertheless, the underlying network is prone to deadlock, despite deadlock-free chiplets, and to different faults on the vertical links used for connecting the chiplets to the interposer. Unfortunately, existing fault-tolerant routing techniques proposed for 2D and 3D on-chip networks cannot be applied to chiplet networks. To address these problems, this paper presents the first deadlock-free and fault-tolerant routing algorithm, called DeFT, for 2.5D integrated chiplet systems. DeFT improves the redundancy in vertical-link selection to tolerate faults in vertical links while considering network congestion. Moreover, DeFT can tolerate different vertical-link-fault scenarios while accounting for vertical-link utilization. Compared to the state-of-the-art routing algorithms in 2.5D chiplet systems, our simulation results show that DeFT improves network reachability by up to 75% with a fault rate of up to 25% and reduces the network latency by up to 40% for multi-application execution scenarios with less than 2% area overhead.",

Despite their diverse deployment, most microcomb-based systems rely on a tremendous amount of bulk equipment to fulfill their desired functions, which is rather complicated, expensive and power-consuming. On the other hand, foundry-based silicon photonics (SiPh) has had remarkable success in providing versatile functionality in a scalable and low-cost manner, but its available chip-based light sources lack the capacity for parallelization, which limits the scope of SiPh applications. Here, we bridge these two technologies by using a power-efficient and operationally-simple AlGaAs on insulator microcomb source to drive CMOS SiPh engines. We present two important chip-scale photonic systems for optical data transmissions and microwave photonics respectively: The first microcomb-based integrated photonic data link is demonstrated, based on a pulse-amplitude 4-level modulation scheme with 2 Tbps aggregate rate, and a highly reconfigurable microwave photonic filter with unprecedented integration level is constructed, using a time stretch scheme.

Yet, differing from real neural tissue, traditional computing architectures physically separate the core computing functions of memory and processing, making fast, efficient and low-energy brain-like computing difficult to achieve. To overcome such limitations, an attractive and alternative goal is to design direct hardware mimics of brain neurons and synapses which, when connected in appropriate networks (or neuromorphic systems), process information in a way more fundamentally analogous to that of real brains. Here we present an all-optical approach to achieving such a goal. Specifically, we demonstrate an all-optical spiking neuron device and connect it, via an integrated photonics network, to photonic synapses to deliver a small-scale all-optical neurosynaptic system capable of supervised and unsupervised learning. Moreover, we exploit wavelength division multiplexing techniques to implement a scalable circuit architecture for photonic neural networks, successfully demonstrating pattern recognition directly in the optical domain using a photonic system comprising 140 elements. Such optical implementations of neurosynaptic networks promise access to the high speed and bandwidth inherent to optical systems, which would be very attractive for the direct processing of telecommunication and visual data in the optical domain.",

This training requires 10^18 single precision operations in total. On the other hand, the world's current fastest supercomputer can finish 2 * 10^17 single precision operations per second (Dongarra et al 2017, this https URL). If we can make full use of the supercomputer for DNN training, we should be able to finish the 90-epoch ResNet-50 training in one minute. However, the current bottleneck for fast DNN training is in the algorithm level. Specifically, the current batch size (e.g. 512) is too small to make efficient use of many processors. For large-scale DNN training, we focus on using large-batch data-parallelism synchronous SGD without losing accuracy in the fixed epochs. The LARS algorithm (You, Gitman, Ginsburg, 2017, arXiv:1708.03888) enables us to scale the batch size to extremely large case (e.g. 32K). We finish the 100-epoch ImageNet training with AlexNet in 11 minutes on 1024 CPUs. About three times faster than Facebook's result (Goyal et al 2017, arXiv:1706.02677), we finish the 90-epoch ImageNet training with ResNet-50 in 20 minutes on 2048 KNLs without losing accuracy. State-of-the-art ImageNet training speed with ResNet-50 is 74.9% top-1 test accuracy in 15 minutes. We got 74.9% top-1 test accuracy in 64 epochs, which only needs 14 minutes. Furthermore, when we increase the batch size to above 16K, our accuracy is much higher than Facebook's on corresponding batch sizes. Our source code is available upon request.",

As a result these models are costly to train and develop, both financially, due to the cost of hardware and electricity or cloud compute time, and environmentally, due to the carbon footprint required to fuel modern tensor processing hardware.

Of particular interest are artificial neural networks, since matrix-vector multi- plications, which are used heavily in artificial neural networks, can be done efficiently in photonic circuits. The training of an artificial neural network is a crucial step in its application. However, currently on the integrated photonics platform there is no efficient protocol for the training of these networks. In this work, we introduce a method that enables highly efficient, in situ training of a photonic neural network. We use adjoint variable methods to derive the photonic analogue of the backpropagation algorithm, which is the standard method for computing gradients of conventional neural networks. We further show how these gradients may be obtained exactly by performing intensity measurements within the device. As an application, we demonstrate the training of a numerically simulated photonic artificial neural network. Beyond the training of photonic machine learning implementations, our method may also be of broad interest to experimental sensitivity analysis of photonic systems and the optimization of reconfigurable optics platforms.",

Here, we present a new configuration algorithm, related to the $2\\times 2$ block decomposition of a unitary matrix, that overcomes this limitation. Our proposed algorithm is robust to errors, requires no prior knowledge of the process variations, and relies only on external sources and detectors. We show that self-configuration using this technique reduces the effect of fabrication errors by the same quadratic factor observed in triangular meshes. This relaxes a significant limit to the size of multiport interferometers, removing a major roadblock to the scaling of optical quantum and machine-learning hardware.",

The most efficient and well-entrenched method to train such networks is backpropagation, or reverse-mode automatic differentiation. To counter an exponentially increasing energy budget in the artificial intelligence sector, there has been recent interest in analog implementations of neural networks, specifically nanophotonic neural networks for which no analog backpropagation demonstration exists. We design mass-manufacturable silicon photonic neural networks that alternately cascade our custom designed \"photonic mesh\" accelerator with digitally implemented nonlinearities. These reconfigurable photonic meshes program computationally intensive arbitrary matrix multiplication by setting physical voltages that tune the interference of optically encoded input data propagating through integrated Mach-Zehnder interferometer networks. Here, using our packaged photonic chip, we demonstrate in situ backpropagation for the first time to solve classification tasks and evaluate a new protocol to keep the entire gradient measurement and update of physical device voltages in the analog domain, improving on past theoretical proposals. Our method is made possible by introducing three changes to typical photonic meshes: (1) measurements at optical \"grating tap\" monitors, (2) bidirectional optical signal propagation automated by fiber switch, and (3) universal generation and readout of optical amplitude and phase. After training, our classification achieves accuracies similar to digital equivalents even in presence of systematic error. Our findings suggest a new training paradigm for photonics-accelerated artificial intelligence based entirely on a physical analog of the popular backpropagation technique.",

This paper evaluates a custom ASIC---called a Tensor Processing Unit (TPU)---deployed in datacenters since 2015 that accelerates the inference phase of neural networks (NN). The heart of the TPU is a 65,536 8-bit MAC matrix multiply unit that offers a peak throughput of 92 TeraOps/second (TOPS) and a large (28 MiB) software-managed on-chip memory. The TPU's deterministic execution model is a better match to the 99th-percentile response-time requirement of our NN applications than are the time-varying optimizations of CPUs and GPUs (caches, out-of-order execution, multithreading, multiprocessing, prefetching, ...) that help average throughput more than guaranteed latency. The lack of such features helps explain why, despite having myriad MACs and a big memory, the TPU is relatively small and low power. We compare the TPU to a server-class Intel Haswell CPU and an Nvidia K80 GPU, which are contemporaries deployed in the same datacenters. Our workload, written in the high-level TensorFlow framework, uses production NN applications (MLPs, CNNs, and LSTMs) that represent 95% of our datacenters' NN inference demand. Despite low utilization for some applications, the TPU is on average about 15X - 30X faster than its contemporary GPU or CPU, with TOPS/Watt about 30X - 80X higher. Moreover, using the GPU's GDDR5 memory in the TPU would triple achieved TOPS and raise TOPS/Watt to nearly 70X the GPU and 200X the CPU.",

A major obstacle to scaling up these systems is static fabrication error, where small component errors within each device accrue to produce significant errors within the circuit computation. Mitigating this error usually requires numerical optimization dependent on real-time feedback from the circuit, which can greatly limit the scalability of the hardware. Here we present a deterministic approach to correcting circuit errors by locally correcting hardware errors within individual optical gates. We apply our approach to simulations of large scale optical neural networks and infinite impulse response filters implemented in programmable photonics, finding that they remain resilient to component error well beyond modern day process tolerances. Our results highlight a new avenue for scaling up programmable photonics to hundreds of modes within current day fabrication processes.",

However, there are many cases that require the models to adapt to new environments, domains, or new users. In order to realize such domain adaption or personalization, the models on devices need to be continuously trained on the device. In this work, we design EF-Train, an efficient DNN training accelerator with a unified channel-level parallelism-based convolution kernel that can achieve end-to-end training on resource-limited low-power edge-level FPGAs. It is challenging to implement on-device training on resource-limited FPGAs due to the low efficiency caused by different memory access patterns among forward, backward propagation, and weight update. Therefore, we developed a data reshaping approach with intra-tile continuous memory allocation and weight reuse. An analytical model is established to automatically schedule computation and memory resources to achieve high energy efficiency on edge FPGAs. The experimental results show that our design achieves 46.99 GFLOPS and 6.09GFLOPS/W in terms of throughput and energy efficiency, respectively.",

As such, fast and low-energy hardware support for accurate NN search is highly desirable. Ternary content-addressable memories (TCAMs) have been proposed to accelerate NN search for few-shot learning tasks by implementing $L_\\infty$ and Hamming distance metrics, but they cannot achieve software-comparable accuracies. This paper proposes a novel distance function that can be natively evaluated with multi-bit content-addressable memories (MCAMs) based on ferroelectric FETs (FeFETs) to perform a single-step, in-memory NN search. Moreover, this approach achieves accuracies comparable to floating-point precision implementations in software for NN classification and one/few-shot learning tasks. As an example, the proposed method achieves a 98.34% accuracy for a 5-way, 5-shot classification task for the Omniglot dataset (only 0.8% lower than software-based implementations) with a 3-bit MCAM. This represents a 13% accuracy improvement over state-of-the-art TCAM-based implementations at iso-energy and iso-delay. The presented distance function is resilient to the effects of FeFET device-to-device variations. Furthermore, this work experimentally demonstrates a 2-bit implementation of FeFET MCAM using AND arrays from GLOBALFOUNDRIES to further validate proof of concept.",

When employed for machine learning tasks such as learning and classification, HDC involves manipulation and comparison of large patterns within memory. Moreover, a key attribute of HDC is its robustness to the imperfections associated with the computational substrates on which it is implemented. It is therefore particularly amenable to emerging non-von Neumann paradigms such as in-memory computing, where the physical attributes of nanoscale memristive devices are exploited to perform computation in place. Here, we present a complete in-memory HDC system that achieves a near optimum trade-off between design complexity and classification accuracy based on three prototypical HDC related learning tasks, namely, language classification, news classification, and hand gesture recognition from electromyography signals. Comparable accuracies to software implementations are demonstrated, experimentally, using 760,000 phase-change memory devices performing analog in-memory computing.",

While custom hardware helps the computation, fetching weights from DRAM is two orders of magnitude more expensive than ALU operations, and dominates the required power.\nPreviously proposed 'Deep Compression' makes it possible to fit large DNNs (AlexNet and VGGNet) fully in on-chip SRAM. This compression is achieved by pruning the redundant connections and having multiple connections share the same weight. We propose an energy efficient inference engine (EIE) that performs inference on this compressed network model and accelerates the resulting sparse matrix-vector multiplication with weight sharing. Going from DRAM to SRAM gives EIE 120x energy saving; Exploiting sparsity saves 10x; Weight sharing gives 8x; Skipping zero activations from ReLU saves another 3x. Evaluated on nine DNN benchmarks, EIE is 189x and 13x faster when compared to CPU and GPU implementations of the same DNN without compression. EIE has a processing power of 102GOPS/s working directly on a compressed network, corresponding to 3TOPS/s on an uncompressed network, and processes FC layers of AlexNet at 1.88x10^4 frames/sec with a power dissipation of only 600mW. It is 24,000x and 3,400x more energy efficient than a CPU and GPU respectively. Compared with DaDianNao, EIE has 2.9x, 19x and 3x better throughput, energy efficiency and area efficiency.",

Quantum error correction is expected to eventually enable fault-tolerant quantum computation at large scales, but until then it will be necessary to use alternative strategies to mitigate the impact of errors. We propose a near-term friendly strategy to mitigate errors by entangling and measuring $M$ copies of a noisy state $\\rho$. This enables us to estimate expectation values with respect to a state with dramatically reduced error, $\\rho^M/ \\mathrm{Tr}(\\rho^M)$, without explicitly preparing it, hence the name \"virtual distillation\". As $M$ increases, this state approaches the closest pure state to $\\rho$, exponentially quickly. We analyze the effectiveness of virtual distillation and find that it is governed in many regimes by the behavior of this pure state (corresponding to the dominant eigenvector of $\\rho$). We numerically demonstrate that virtual distillation is capable of suppressing errors by multiple orders of magnitude and explain how this effect is enhanced as the system size grows. Finally, we show that this technique can improve the convergence of randomized quantum algorithms, even in the absence of device noise.",

One way to facilitate large-scale quantum computations is through a distributed network of quantum computers. In this work, we consider the problem of distributing quantum programs represented as quantum circuits across a quantum network of heterogeneous quantum computers, in a way that minimizes the overall communication cost required to execute the distributed circuit. We consider two ways of communicating: cat-entanglement that creates linked copies of qubits across pairs of computers, and teleportation. The heterogeneous computers impose constraints on cat-entanglement and teleportation operations that can be chosen by an algorithm. We first focus on a special case that only allows cat-entanglements and not teleportations for communication. We provide a two-step heuristic for solving this specialized setting: (i) finding an assignment of qubits to computers using Tabu search, and (ii) using an iterative greedy algorithm designed for a constrained version of the set cover problem to determine cat-entanglement operations required to execute gates locally.\nFor the general case, which allows both forms of communication, we propose two algorithms that subdivide the quantum circuit into several portions and apply the heuristic for the specialized setting on each portion. Teleportations are then used to stitch together the solutions for each portion. Finally, we simulate our algorithms on a wide range of randomly generated quantum networks and circuits, and study the properties of their results with respect to several varying parameters.",

This paper presents a new type of photonic accelerator based on coherent detection that is scalable to large ($N \\gtrsim 10^6$) networks and can be operated at high (GHz) speeds and very low (sub-aJ) energies per multiply-and-accumulate (MAC), using the massive spatial multiplexing enabled by standard free-space optical components. In contrast to previous approaches, both weights and inputs are optically encoded so that the network can be reprogrammed and trained on the fly. Simulations of the network using models for digit- and image-classification reveal a \"standard quantum limit\" for optical neural networks, set by photodetector shot noise. This bound, which can be as low as 50 zJ/MAC, suggests performance below the thermodynamic (Landauer) limit for digital irreversible computation is theoretically possible in this device. The proposed accelerator can implement both fully-connected and convolutional networks. We also present a scheme for back-propagation and training that can be performed in the same hardware. This architecture will enable a new class of ultra-low-energy processors for deep learning.",

Each neuron is required to exhibit a directionally dependent response to propagating optical signals, with the backwards response conditioned on the forward signal, which is highly non-trivial to implement optically. We propose a practical and surprisingly simple solution that uses saturable absorption to provide the network nonlinearity. We find that the backward propagating gradients required to train the network can be approximated in a pump-probe scheme that requires only passive optical elements. Simulations show that, with readily obtainable optical depths, our approach can achieve equivalent performance to state-of-the-art computational networks on image classification benchmarks, even in deep networks with multiple sequential gradient approximations. This scheme is compatible with leading optical neural network proposals and therefore provides a feasible path towards end-to-end optical training.",

Analog neuromorphic hardware uses the same principles to emulate spiking neural networks with exceptional energy-efficiency. However, instantiating high-performing spiking networks on such hardware remains a significant challenge due to device mismatch and the lack of efficient training algorithms. Here, we introduce a general in-the-loop learning framework based on surrogate gradients that resolves these issues. Using the BrainScaleS-2 neuromorphic system, we show that learning self-corrects for device mismatch resulting in competitive spiking network performance on both vision and speech benchmarks. Our networks display sparse spiking activity with, on average, far less than one spike per hidden neuron and input, perform inference at rates of up to 85 k frames/second, and consume less than 200 mW. In summary, our work sets several new benchmarks for low-energy spiking network processing on analog neuromorphic hardware and paves the way for future on-chip learning algorithms.",

Mitigating this error usually requires numerical optimization dependent on real-time feedback from the circuit, which can greatly limit the scalability of the hardware. Here we present a deterministic approach to correcting circuit errors by locally correcting hardware errors within individual optical gates. We apply our approach to simulations of large scale optical neural networks and infinite impulse response filters implemented in programmable photonics, finding that they remain resilient to component error well beyond modern day process tolerances.

Milestones of deep learning exceeding human performance have been achieved for a growing number of tasks over the past several years, across areas as diverse as game-playing, natural-language translation, and medical-image analysis. However, continued progress is increasingly hampered by the high energy costs associated with training and running deep neural networks on electronic processors. Optical neural networks have attracted attention as an alternative physical platform for deep learning, as it has been theoretically predicted that they can fundamentally achieve higher energy efficiency than neural networks deployed on conventional digital computers. Here, we experimentally demonstrate an optical neural network achieving 99% accuracy on handwritten-digit classification using ~3.2 detected photons per weight multiplication and ~90% accuracy using ~0.64 photons (~$2.4 \\times 10^{-19}$ J of optical energy) per weight multiplication. This performance was achieved using a custom free-space optical processor that executes matrix-vector multiplications in a massively parallel fashion, with up to ~0.5 million scalar (weight) multiplications performed at the same time. Using commercially available optical components and standard neural-network training methods, we demonstrated that optical neural networks can operate near the standard quantum limit with extremely low optical powers and still achieve high accuracy. Our results provide a proof-of-principle for low-optical-power operation, and with careful system design including the surrounding electronics used for data storage and control, open up a path to realizing optical processors that require only $10^{-16}$ J total energy per scalar multiplication -- which is orders of magnitude more efficient than current digital processors.",

Here, we demonstrate a computational specific integrated photonic tensor core - the optical analog of an ASIC-capable of operating at Tera-Multiply-Accumulate per second (TMAC/s) speeds. The photonic core achieves parallelized photonic in-memory computing using phase-change memory arrays and photonic chip-based optical frequency combs (soliton microcombs). The computation is reduced to measuring the optical transmission of reconfigurable and non-resonant passive components and can operate at a bandwidth exceeding 14 GHz, limited only by the speed of the modulators and photodetectors. Given recent advances in hybrid integration of soliton microcombs at microwave line rates, ultra-low loss silicon nitride waveguides, and high speed on-chip detectors and modulators, our approach provides a path towards full CMOS wafer-scale integration of the photonic tensor core.

Using a time-domain spectroscopy setup with a plasmonic nanoantenna-based detector, we experimentally validated this machine vision framework at terahertz spectrum to optically classify the images of handwritten digits by detecting the spectral power of the diffracted light at ten distinct wavelengths, each representing one class/digit. We also report the coupling of this spectral encoding achieved through a diffractive optical network with a shallow electronic neural network, separately trained to reconstruct the images of handwritten digits based on solely the spectral information encoded in these ten distinct wavelengths within the diffracted light. These reconstructed images demonstrate task-specific image decompression and can also be cycled back as new inputs to the same diffractive network to improve its optical object classification. This unique machine vision framework merges the power of deep learning with the spatial and spectral processing capabilities of diffractive networks, and can also be extended to other spectral-domain measurement systems to enable new 3D imaging and sensing modalities integrated with spectrally encoded classification tasks performed through diffractive optical networks.",

While quantum computing is still in its infancy, the variety of different architectures used to implement quantum computations make it difficult to reliably measure and compare performance. This problem motivates our introduction of SupermarQ, a scalable, hardware-agnostic quantum benchmark suite which uses application-level metrics to measure performance. SupermarQ is the first attempt to systematically apply techniques from classical benchmarking methodology to the quantum domain. We define a set of feature vectors to quantify coverage, select applications from a variety of domains to ensure the suite is representative of real workloads, and collect benchmark results from the IBM, IonQ, and AQT@LBNL platforms. Looking forward, we envision that quantum benchmarking will encompass a large cross-community effort built on open source, constantly evolving benchmark suites.

Recent work has predicted that coupling between noisy environments and disordered systems, in which coherent transport has been arrested due to localization effects, could actually enhance transport. Photonic integrated circuits are promising platforms for studying such effects, with a central goal being the development of large systems providing low-loss, high-fidelity control over all parameters of the transport problem. Here, we fully map the role of disorder in quantum transport using a nanophotonic processor consisting of a mesh of 88 generalized beamsplitters programmable on microsecond timescales. Over 64,400 transport experiments, we observe several distinct transport regimes, including environment-assisted quantum transport and the ''quantum Goldilocks'' regime in strong, statically disordered discrete-time systems. Low loss and high-fidelity programmable transformations make this nanophotonic processor a promising platform for many-boson quantum simulation experiments.",

If device components are initialized uniform-randomly, the locally-interacting nature of the mesh components biases the optimization search space towards banded unitary matrices, limiting convergence to random unitary matrices. We detail a procedure for initializing the device by sampling from the distribution of random unitary matrices and show that this greatly improves convergence speed.

A major obstacle to scaling up these systems is static fabrication error, where small component errors within each device accrue to produce significant errors within the circuit computation. Mitigating this error usually requires numerical optimization dependent on real-time feedback from the circuit, which can greatly limit the scalability of the hardware. Here we present a deterministic approach to correcting circuit errors by locally correcting hardware errors within individual optical gates. We apply our approach to simulations of large scale optical neural networks and infinite impulse response filters implemented in programmable photonics, finding that they remain resilient to component error well beyond modern day process tolerances. Our results highlight a new avenue for scaling up programmable photonics to hundreds of modes within current day fabrication processes.",

We use a continuous-variable quantum neural network as the circuit architecture. The network is composed of several layers of optical gates with variable parameters that are optimized by applying automatic differentiation using the TensorFlow backend of the Strawberry Fields photonic quantum computer simulator. We demonstrate the power and versatility of our methods by learning how to use short-depth circuits to synthesize single photons, Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill states, NOON states, cubic phase gates, random unitaries, cross-Kerr interactions, as well as several other states and gates. We routinely obtain high fidelities above 99\\% using short-depth circuits, typically consisting of a few hundred gates. The circuits are obtained automatically by simply specifying the target state or gate and running the optimization algorithm.",

Using AI components or micro benchmarks alone can lead to error-prone conclusions. This paper presents a methodology to attack the above challenge. We formalize a real-world application scenario as a Directed Acyclic Graph-based model and propose the rules to distill it into a permutation of essential AI and non-AI tasks, which we call a scenario benchmark. Together with seventeen industry partners, we extract nine typical scenario benchmarks. We design and implement an extensible, configurable, and flexible benchmark framework. We implement two Internet service AI scenario benchmarks based on the framework as proxies to two real-world application scenarios. We consider scenario, component, and micro benchmarks as three indispensable parts for evaluating. Our evaluation shows the advantage of our methodology against using component or micro AI benchmarks alone.

While quantum computing is still in its infancy, the variety of different architectures used to implement quantum computations make it difficult to reliably measure and compare performance. This problem motivates our introduction of SupermarQ, a scalable, hardware-agnostic quantum benchmark suite which uses application-level metrics to measure performance. SupermarQ is the first attempt to systematically apply techniques from classical benchmarking methodology to the quantum domain. We define a set of feature vectors to quantify coverage, select applications from a variety of domains to ensure the suite is representative of real workloads, and collect benchmark results from the IBM, IonQ, and AQT@LBNL platforms. Looking forward, we envision that quantum benchmarking will encompass a large cross-community effort built on open source, constantly evolving benchmark suites.

Dynamically remapping logical qubits to physical qubits in the compiler is needed to enable the two-qubit gates in the algorithm, which introduces additional operations and inevitably reduces the fidelity of the algorithm. Previous solutions in finding such remapping suffer from high complexity, poor initial mapping quality, and limited flexibility and controllability.\nTo address these drawbacks mentioned above, this paper proposes a SWAP-based BidiREctional heuristic search algorithm SABRE, which is applicable to NISQ devices with arbitrary connections between qubits. By optimizing every search attempt,globally optimizing the initial mapping using a novel reverse traversal technique, introducing the decay effect to enable the trade-off between the depth and the number of gates of the entire algorithm, SABRE outperforms the best known algorithm with exponential speedup and comparable or better results on various benchmarks.",

We study the task of sampling from the output distributions of (pseudo-)random quantum circuits, a natural task for benchmarking quantum computers. Crucially, sampling this distribution classically requires a direct numerical simulation of the circuit, with computational cost exponential in the number of qubits. This requirement is typical of chaotic systems. We extend previous results in computational complexity to argue more formally that this sampling task must take exponential time in a classical computer. We study the convergence to the chaotic regime using extensive supercomputer simulations, modeling circuits with up to 42 qubits - the largest quantum circuits simulated to date for a computational task that approaches quantum supremacy. We argue that while chaotic states are extremely sensitive to errors, quantum supremacy can be achieved in the near-term with approximately fifty superconducting qubits. We introduce cross entropy as a useful benchmark of quantum circuits which approximates the circuit fidelity. We show that the cross entropy can be efficiently measured when circuit simulations are available. Beyond the classically tractable regime, the cross entropy can be extrapolated and compared with theoretical estimates of circuit fidelity to define a practical quantum supremacy test.",

The unintentional coupling of qubits to their environment and each other adds significant noise to computation, and improved methods to combat decoherence are required to boost the performance of quantum algorithms on real machines. While many existing techniques for mitigating error rely on adding extra gates to the circuit, calibrating new gates, or extending a circuit's runtime, this paper's primary contribution leverages the gates already present in a quantum program without extending circuit duration. We exploit circuit slack for single-qubit gates that occur in idle windows, scheduling the gates such that their timing can counteract some errors.\nSpin-echo corrections that mitigate decoherence on idling qubits act as inspiration for this work. Theoretical models, however, fail to capture all sources of noise in NISQ devices, making practical solutions necessary that better minimize the impact of unpredictable errors in quantum machines. This paper presents TimeStitch: a novel framework that pinpoints the optimum execution schedules for single-qubit gates within quantum circuits. TimeStitch, implemented as a compilation pass, leverages the reversible nature of quantum computation to boost the success of circuits on real quantum machines.",

Central to this quest is to give machines the ability to estimate the likeness or similarity between things in the way human beings estimate the similarity between stimuli.\nIn this context, this book focuses on semantic measures: approaches designed for comparing semantic entities such as units of language, e.g. words, sentences, or concepts and instances defined into knowledge bases. The aim of these measures is to assess the similarity or relatedness of such semantic entities by taking into account their semantics, i.e. their meaning -- intuitively, the words tea and coffee, which both refer to stimulating beverage, will be estimated to be more semantically similar than the words toffee (confection) and coffee, despite that the last pair has a higher syntactic similarity. The two state-of-the-art approaches for estimating and quantifying semantic similarities/relatedness of semantic entities are presented in detail: the first one relies on corpora analysis and is based on Natural Language Processing techniques and semantic models while the second is based on more or less formal, computer-readable and workable forms of knowledge such as semantic networks, thesaurus or ontologies. (...) Beyond a simple inventory and categorization of existing measures, the aim of this monograph is to convey novices as well as researchers of these domains towards a better understanding of semantic similarity estimation and more generally semantic measures.",

Our simulator includes a physics engine that can operate at a high frequency for real-time hardware-in-the-loop (HITL) simulations with support for popular protocols (e.g. MavLink). The simulator is designed from the ground up to be extensible to accommodate new types of vehicles, hardware platforms and software protocols.

However, not all domains of machine learning have benefited equally from quantum enhancements. Notably, deep learning and reinforcement learning, despite their tremendous success in the classical domain, both individually and combined, remain relatively unaddressed by the quantum community. Arguably, one reason behind this is the systematic use in these domains of models and methods without prominent computational bottlenecks, leaving little room for quantum improvements. In this work, we study the state-of-the-art neural-network approaches for reinforcement learning with quantum enhancements in mind. We demonstrate the substantial learning advantage that models with a sampling bottleneck can provide over conventional neural network architectures in complex learning environments. These so-called energy-based models, like deep energy-based reinforcement learning, and deep projective simulation that we also introduce in this work, effectively allow to trade off learning performance for efficiency of computation. To alleviate the additional computational costs, we propose to leverage future and near-term quantum algorithms, resulting in overall more advantageous learning algorithms. This is achieved using cutting-edge and new quantum computing machinery to speed-up classical sampling methods and by employing generalized models to gain an additional quantum advantage.",

To bridge the gap, this work proposes an end-to-end learning framework named QTN-VQC, by introducing a trainable quantum tensor network (QTN) for quantum embedding on a variational quantum circuit (VQC). The architecture of QTN is composed of a parametric tensor-train network for feature extraction and a tensor product encoding for quantum embedding. We highlight the QTN for quantum embedding in terms of two perspectives: (1) we theoretically characterize QTN by analyzing its representation power of input features; (2) QTN enables an end-to-end parametric model pipeline, namely QTN-VQC, from the generation of quantum embedding to the output measurement. Our experiments on the MNIST dataset demonstrate the advantages of QTN for quantum embedding over other quantum embedding approaches.",

MEC is the first permanently deployed near-infrared MKID instrument and is designed to operate both as an IFU, and as a focal plane wavefront sensor in a multi-kHz feedback loop with SCExAO. The read noise free, fast time domain information attainable by MKIDs allows for the direct probing of fast speckle fluctuations that currently limit the performance of most high contrast imaging systems on the ground and will help MEC achieve its ultimate goal of reaching contrasts of $10^{-7}$ at 2$\\lambda / D$.

A great deal of theoretical algorithmic development has been performed in support of this goal. Most techniques require a scheme for mapping electronic states and operations to states of and operations upon qubits. The two most commonly used techniques for this are the Jordan-Wigner transformation and the Bravyi-Kitaev transformation. However, comparisons of these schemes have previously been limited to individual small molecules. In this paper we discuss resource implications for the use of the Bravyi-Kitaev mapping scheme, specifically with regard to the number of quantum gates required for simulation. We consider both small systems which may be simulatable on near-future quantum devices, and systems sufficiently large for classical simulation to be intractable. We use 86 molecular systems to demonstrate that the use of the Bravyi-Kitaev transformation is typically at least approximately as efficient as the canonical Jordan-Wigner transformation, and results in substantially reduced gate count estimates when performing limited circuit optimisations.",

Prior work has bounded errors due to Trotterization in terms of the norm of the error operator and analyzed scaling with respect to the number of spin-orbitals. However, we find that these error bounds can be loose by up to sixteen orders of magnitude for some molecules. Furthermore, numerical results for small systems fail to reveal any clear correlation between ground state error and number of spin-orbitals. We instead argue that chemical properties, such as the maximum nuclear charge in a molecule and the filling fraction of orbitals, can be decisive for determining the cost of a quantum simulation. Our analysis motivates several strategies to use classical processing to further reduce the required Trotter step size and to estimate the necessary number of steps, without requiring additional quantum resources. Finally, we demonstrate improved methods for state preparation techniques which are asymptotically superior to proposals in the simulation literature.",

                        "Citation Paper Abstract": "Abstract:Programmable metasurfaces have garnered significant attention as they confer unprecedented control over the electromagnetic response of any surface. Such feature has given rise to novel design paradigms such as Software-Defined Metamaterials (SDM) and Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS) with multiple groundbreaking applications. However, the development of programmable metasurfaces tailored to the particularities of a potentially broad application pool becomes a daunting task because the design space becomes remarkably large. This paper aims to ease the design process by proposing a methodology that, through a semi-analytical model of the metasurface response, allows to derive performance scaling trends as functions of a representative set of design variables. Although the methodology is amenable to any electromagnetic functionality, this paper explores its use for the case of beam steering at 26 GHz for 5G applications. Conventional beam steering metrics are evaluated as functions of the unit cell size, number of unit cell states, and metasurface size for different incidence and reflection angles. It is shown that metasurfaces 5$\\lambda\\times$5$\\lambda$ or larger with unit cells of $\\lambda/3$ and four unit cell states ensure good performance overall. Further, it is demonstrated that performance degrades significantly for angles larger than $\\theta > 60^o$ and that, to combat this, extra effort is needed in the development of the unit cell. These performance trends, when combined with power and cost models, will pave the way to optimal metasurface dimensioning.",

In particular, PLS can be employed to provide i) node authentication, ii) message authentication, and, iii) message confidentiality. Unlike the corresponding classical cryptographic approaches which are all based on computational security, PLS's added strength is that it is based on information theoretic security, in which no limitation with respect to the opponent's computational power is assumed and is therefore inherently quantum resistant. In this survey, we review the aforementioned fundamental aspects of PLS, starting with node authentication, moving to the information theoretic characterization of message integrity, and finally, discussing message confidentiality both in the secret key generation from shared randomness and from the wiretap channel point of view. The aim of this review is to provide a comprehensive roadmap on important relevant results by the authors and other contributors and discuss open issues on the applicability of PLS in sixth generation systems.",

When multiple instructions are executed in parallel, crosstalk between the instructions can corrupt the quantum state and lead to incorrect program execution. Our goal is to mitigate the application impact of crosstalk noise through software techniques. This requires (i) accurate characterization of hardware crosstalk, and (ii) intelligent instruction scheduling to serialize the affected operations. Since crosstalk characterization is computationally expensive, we develop optimizations which reduce the characterization overhead. On three 20-qubit IBMQ systems, we demonstrate two orders of magnitude reduction in characterization time (compute time on the QC device) compared to all-pairs crosstalk measurements. Informed by these characterization, we develop a scheduler that judiciously serializes high crosstalk instructions balancing the need to mitigate crosstalk and exponential decoherence errors from serialization. On real-system runs on three IBMQ systems, our scheduler improves the error rate of application circuits by up to 5.6x, compared to the IBM instruction scheduler and offers near-optimal crosstalk mitigation in practice.\nIn a broader picture, the difficulty of mitigating crosstalk has recently driven QC vendors to move towards sparser qubit connectivity or disabling nearby operations entirely in hardware, which can be detrimental to performance. Our work makes the case for software mitigation of crosstalk errors.",

Additionally, we demonstrate how to build mobile semantic segmentation models through a reduced form of DeepLabv3 which we call Mobile DeepLabv3.\nThe MobileNetV2 architecture is based on an inverted residual structure where the input and output of the residual block are thin bottleneck layers opposite to traditional residual models which use expanded representations in the input an MobileNetV2 uses lightweight depthwise convolutions to filter features in the intermediate expansion layer. Additionally, we find that it is important to remove non-linearities in the narrow layers in order to maintain representational power. We demonstrate that this improves performance and provide an intuition that led to this design. Finally, our approach allows decoupling of the input/output domains from the expressiveness of the transformation, which provides a convenient framework for further analysis.

Most of these learning algorithms either assume quantum access to data -- making it unclear if quantum speed-ups still exist without making these strong assumptions, or are heuristic in nature with no provable advantage over classical algorithms. In this paper, we establish a rigorous quantum speed-up for supervised classification using a general-purpose quantum learning algorithm that only requires classical access to data. Our quantum classifier is a conventional support vector machine that uses a fault-tolerant quantum computer to estimate a kernel function. Data samples are mapped to a quantum feature space and the kernel entries can be estimated as the transition amplitude of a quantum circuit. We construct a family of datasets and show that no classical learner can classify the data inverse-polynomially better than random guessing, assuming the widely-believed hardness of the discrete logarithm problem. Meanwhile, the quantum classifier achieves high accuracy and is robust against additive errors in the kernel entries that arise from finite sampling statistics.",

Here we introduce a quantum information-based algorithm implementing the quantum computer version of a perceptron, which shows exponential advantage in encoding resources over alternative realizations. We experimentally test a few qubits version of this model on an actual small-scale quantum processor, which gives remarkably good answers against the expected results.

For quantum systems, where the dimension of the problem space grows exponentially, finding the eigenvalues of certain operators is one such intractable problem and remains a fundamental challenge. The quantum phase estimation algorithm can efficiently find the eigenvalue of a given eigenvector but requires fully coherent evolution. We present an alternative approach that greatly reduces the requirements for coherent evolution and we combine this method with a new approach to state preparation based on ans\u00e4tze and classical optimization. We have implemented the algorithm by combining a small-scale photonic quantum processor with a conventional computer. We experimentally demonstrate the feasibility of this approach with an example from quantum chemistry: calculating the ground state molecular energy for He-H+, to within chemical accuracy. The proposed approach, by drastically reducing the coherence time requirements, enhances the potential of the quantum resources available today and in the near future.",

The power system is facing a transition from its traditional hierarchical structure to a more deregulated model by introducing new energy distribution models such as peer-to-peer sharing for connected communities. The proven effectiveness of P2P sharing in benefiting both prosumers and the grid has been demonstrated in many studies and pilot projects. However, there is still no extensive implementation of such sharing models in today's electricity markets. This paper aims to shed some light on this gap through a comprehensive overview of recent advances in the P2P energy system and an insightful discussion of the challenges that need to be addressed in order to establish P2P sharing as a viable energy management option in today's electricity market. To this end, in this article, we provide some background on different aspects of P2P sharing. Then, we discuss advances in P2P sharing through a systematic domain-based classification. We also review different pilot projects on P2P sharing across the globe. Finally, we identify and discuss a number of challenges that need to be addressed for scaling up P2P sharing in the electricity market followed by concluding remarks at the end of the paper.",

The general problem of quantum compiling is to approximate any unitary transformation that describes the quantum computation, as a sequence of elements selected from a finite base of universal quantum gates. The existence of an approximating sequence of one qubit quantum gates is guaranteed by the Solovay-Kitaev theorem, which implies sub-optimal algorithms to establish it explicitly. Since a unitary transformation may require significantly different gate sequences, depending on the base considered, such a problem is of great complexity and does not admit an efficient approximating algorithm. Therefore, traditional approaches are time-consuming tasks, unsuitable to be employed during quantum computation. We exploit the deep reinforcement learning method as an alternative strategy, which has a significantly different trade-off between search time and exploitation time. Deep reinforcement learning allows creating single-qubit operations in real time, after an arbitrary long training period during which a strategy for creating sequences to approximate unitary operators is built. The deep reinforcement learning based compiling method allows for fast computation times, which could in principle be exploited for real-time quantum compiling.",

We propose a machine learning algorithm for continuous quantum error correction that is based on the use of a recurrent neural network to identify bit-flip errors from continuous noisy syndrome measurements. The algorithm is designed to operate on measurement signals deviating from the ideal behavior in which the mean value corresponds to a code syndrome value and the measurement has white noise. We analyze continuous measurements taken from a superconducting architecture using three transmon qubits to identify three significant practical examples of non-ideal behavior, namely auto-correlation at temporal short lags, transient syndrome dynamics after each bit-flip, and drift in the steady-state syndrome values over the course of many experiments. Based on these real-world imperfections, we generate synthetic measurement signals from which to train the recurrent neural network, and then test its proficiency when implementing active error correction, comparing this with a traditional double threshold scheme and a discrete Bayesian classifier. The results show that our machine learning protocol is able to outperform the double threshold protocol across all tests, achieving a final state fidelity comparable to the discrete Bayesian classifier.",

This procedure can be implemented on near-term quantum computers via quantum process tomography. It enables automatic discovery of logical gates from analytically designed error correcting codes and can be extended to error correcting codes found by numerical optimizations. We test the procedure by simulation on classical computers on small quantum codes of four qubits to fifteen qubits and show that it finds most logical gates known in the current literature.

In recent years, various methods for VQE structure optimization have been introduced but the capacities of machine learning to aid with this problem has not yet been fully investigated. In this work, we propose a reinforcement learning algorithm that autonomously explores the space of possible ans{\u00e4}tze, identifying economic circuits which still yield accurate ground energy estimates. The algorithm is intrinsically motivated, and it incrementally improves the accuracy of the result while minimizing the circuit depth. We showcase the performance of our algorithm on the problem of estimating the ground-state energy of lithium hydride (LiH).

The controller is trained with policy gradient to select a subgraph that maximizes the expected reward on the validation set. Meanwhile the model corresponding to the selected subgraph is trained to minimize a canonical cross entropy loss. Thanks to parameter sharing between child models, ENAS is fast: it delivers strong empirical performances using much fewer GPU-hours than all existing automatic model design approaches, and notably, 1000x less expensive than standard Neural Architecture Search. On the Penn Treebank dataset, ENAS discovers a novel architecture that achieves a test perplexity of 55.8, establishing a new state-of-the-art among all methods without post-training processing. On the CIFAR-10 dataset, ENAS designs novel architectures that achieve a test error of 2.89%, which is on par with NASNet (Zoph et al., 2018), whose test error is 2.65%.",

The DSL is flexible enough to define standard architectures such as the Gated Recurrent Unit and Long Short Term Memory and allows the introduction of non-standard RNN components such as trigonometric curves and layer normalization. Using two different candidate generation techniques, random search with a ranking function and reinforcement learning, we explore the novel architectures produced by the RNN DSL for language modeling and machine translation domains.

The optimal network block is constructed by the learning agent which is trained sequentially to choose component layers. We stack the block to construct the whole auto-generated network. To accelerate the generation process, we also propose a distributed asynchronous framework and an early stop strategy. The block-wise generation brings unique advantages: (1) it performs competitive results in comparison to the hand-crafted state-of-the-art networks on image classification, additionally, the best network generated by BlockQNN achieves 3.54% top-1 error rate on CIFAR-10 which beats all existing auto-generate networks.

However, their success is based on vast computational resources (e.g. hundreds of GPUs), making them difficult to be widely used. A noticeable limitation is that they still design and train each network from scratch during the exploration of the architecture space, which is highly inefficient. In this paper, we propose a new framework toward efficient architecture search by exploring the architecture space based on the current network and reusing its weights. We employ a reinforcement learning agent as the meta-controller, whose action is to grow the network depth or layer width with function-preserving transformations. As such, the previously validated networks can be reused for further exploration, thus saves a large amount of computational cost. We apply our method to explore the architecture space of the plain convolutional neural networks (no skip-connections, branching etc.) on image benchmark datasets (CIFAR-10, SVHN) with restricted computational resources (5 GPUs). Our method can design highly competitive networks that outperform existing networks using the same design scheme. On CIFAR-10, our model without skip-connections achieves 4.23\\% test error rate, exceeding a vast majority of modern architectures and approaching DenseNet. Furthermore, by applying our method to explore the DenseNet architecture space, we are able to achieve more accurate networks with fewer parameters.",

New architectures are handcrafted by careful experimentation or modified from a handful of existing networks. We introduce MetaQNN, a meta-modeling algorithm based on reinforcement learning to automatically generate high-performing CNN architectures for a given learning task. The learning agent is trained to sequentially choose CNN layers using $Q$-learning with an $\\epsilon$-greedy exploration strategy and experience replay. The agent explores a large but finite space of possible architectures and iteratively discovers designs with improved performance on the learning task. On image classification benchmarks, the agent-designed networks (consisting of only standard convolution, pooling, and fully-connected layers) beat existing networks designed with the same layer types and are competitive against the state-of-the-art methods that use more complex layer types. We also outperform existing meta-modeling approaches for network design on image classification tasks.",

While conventional schemes for quantum parameter estimation focus on the optimization of the probe states and measurements, it has been recently realized that control during the evolution can significantly improve the precision. The identification of optimal controls, however, is often computationally demanding, as typically the optimal controls depend on the value of the parameter which then needs to be re-calculated after the update of the estimation in each iteration. Here we show that reinforcement learning provides an efficient way to identify the controls that can be employed to improve the precision. We also demonstrate that reinforcement learning is highly generalizable, namely the neural network trained under one particular value of the parameter can work for different values within a broad range. These desired features make reinforcement learning an efficient alternative to conventional optimal quantum control methods.",

Although supervised machine learning and reinforcement learning are widely used for optimizing control parameters in classical systems, quantum control for parameter optimization is mainly pursued via gradient-based greedy algorithms. Although the quantum fitness landscape is often compatible with greedy algorithms, sometimes greedy algorithms yield poor results, especially for large-dimensional quantum systems. We employ differential evolution algorithms to circumvent the stagnation problem of non-convex optimization. We improve quantum control fidelity for noisy system by averaging over the objective function. To reduce computational cost, we introduce heuristics for early termination of runs and for adaptive selection of search subspaces. Our implementation is massively parallel and vectorized to reduce run time even further. We demonstrate our methods with two examples, namely quantum phase estimation and quantum gate design, for which we achieve superior fidelity and scalability than obtained using greedy algorithms.",

In this work, we perform a comparative study on the efficacy of three reinforcement learning algorithms: tabular Q-learning, deep Q-learning, and policy gradient, as well as two non-machine-learning methods: stochastic gradient descent and Krotov algorithms, in the problem of preparing a desired quantum state. We found that overall, the deep Q-learning and policy gradient algorithms outperform others when the problem is discretized, e.g. allowing discrete values of control, and when the problem scales up. The reinforcement learning algorithms can also adaptively reduce the complexity of the control sequences, shortening the operation time and improving the fidelity.

Yet, preparing states quickly and with high fidelity remains a formidable challenge. In this work we implement cutting-edge Reinforcement Learning (RL) techniques and show that their performance is comparable to optimal control methods in the task of finding short, high-fidelity driving protocol from an initial to a target state in non-integrable many-body quantum systems of interacting qubits. RL methods learn about the underlying physical system solely through a single scalar reward (the fidelity of the resulting state) calculated from numerical simulations of the physical system. We further show that quantum state manipulation, viewed as an optimization problem, exhibits a spin-glass-like phase transition in the space of protocols as a function of the protocol duration. Our RL-aided approach helps identify variational protocols with nearly optimal fidelity, even in the glassy phase, where optimal state manipulation is exponentially hard. This study highlights the potential usefulness of RL for applications in out-of-equilibrium quantum physics.",

                        "Citation Paper Abstract": "Abstract:Neural machine translation is a recently proposed approach to machine translation. Unlike the traditional statistical machine translation, the neural machine translation aims at building a single neural network that can be jointly tuned to maximize the translation performance. The models proposed recently for neural machine translation often belong to a family of encoder-decoders and consists of an encoder that encodes a source sentence into a fixed-length vector from which a decoder generates a translation. In this paper, we conjecture that the use of a fixed-length vector is a bottleneck in improving the performance of this basic encoder-decoder architecture, and propose to extend this by allowing a model to automatically (soft-)search for parts of a source sentence that are relevant to predicting a target word, without having to form these parts as a hard segment explicitly. With this new approach, we achieve a translation performance comparable to the existing state-of-the-art phrase-based system on the task of English-to-French translation. Furthermore, qualitative analysis reveals that the (soft-)alignments found by the model agree well with our intuition.",

Many works have suggested great possibilities of using near-term quantum hardware in supervised learning. Motivated by these developments, we present an embedding-based framework for supervised learning with trainable quantum circuits. We introduce both explicit and implicit approaches. The aim of these approaches is to map data from different classes to separated locations in the Hilbert space via the quantum feature map. We will show that the implicit approach is a generalization of a recently introduced strategy, so-called \\textit{quantum metric learning}. In particular, with the implicit approach, the number of separated classes (or their labels) in supervised learning problems can be arbitrarily high with respect to the number of given qubits, which surpasses the capacity of some current quantum machine learning models. Compared to the explicit method, this implicit approach exhibits certain advantages over small training sizes. Furthermore, we establish an intrinsic connection between the explicit approach and other quantum supervised learning models. Combined with the implicit approach, this connection provides a unified framework for quantum supervised learning. The utility of our framework is demonstrated by performing both noise-free and noisy numerical simulations. Moreover, we have conducted classification testing with both implicit and explicit approaches using several IBM Q devices.",

It is built upon a quantum convolutional neural network (QCNN) composed of a quantum circuit encoder for feature extraction, and a recurrent neural network (RNN) based end-to-end acoustic model (AM). To enhance model parameter protection in a decentralized architecture, an input speech is first up-streamed to a quantum computing server to extract Mel-spectrogram, and the corresponding convolutional features are encoded using a quantum circuit algorithm with random parameters. The encoded features are then down-streamed to the local RNN model for the final recognition. The proposed decentralized framework takes advantage of the quantum learning progress to secure models and to avoid privacy leakage attacks. Testing on the Google Speech Commands Dataset, the proposed QCNN encoder attains a competitive accuracy of 95.12% in a decentralized model, which is better than the previous architectures using centralized RNN models with convolutional features. We also conduct an in-depth study of different quantum circuit encoder architectures to provide insights into designing QCNN-based feature extractors. Neural saliency analyses demonstrate a correlation between the proposed QCNN features, class activation maps, and input spectrograms. We provide an implementation for future studies.",

Such hybrid systems have already shown the potential to tackle real-world tasks in supervised and generative learning, and recent works have established their provable advantages in special artificial tasks. Yet, in the case of reinforcement learning, which is arguably most challenging and where learning boosts would be extremely valuable, no proposal has been successful in solving even standard benchmarking tasks, nor in showing a theoretical learning advantage over classical algorithms. In this work, we achieve both. We propose a hybrid quantum-classical reinforcement learning model using very few qubits, which we show can be effectively trained to solve several standard benchmarking environments. Moreover, we demonstrate, and formally prove, the ability of parametrized quantum circuits to solve certain learning tasks that are intractable for classical models, including current state-of-art deep neural networks, under the widely-believed classical hardness of the discrete logarithm problem.",

Research in this area has focused primarily on variational quantum algorithms (VQAs), and several proposals to enhance supervised, unsupervised and reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms with VQAs have been put forward. Out of the three, RL is the least studied and it is still an open question whether VQAs can be competitive with state-of-the-art classical algorithms based on neural networks (NNs) even on simple benchmark tasks. In this work, we introduce a training method for parametrized quantum circuits (PQCs) that can be used to solve RL tasks for discrete and continuous state spaces based on the deep Q-learning algorithm. We investigate which architectural choices for quantum Q-learning agents are most important for successfully solving certain types of environments by performing ablation studies for a number of different data encoding and readout strategies. We provide insight into why the performance of a VQA-based Q-learning algorithm crucially depends on the observables of the quantum model and show how to choose suitable observables based on the learning task at hand. To compare our model against the classical DQN algorithm, we perform an extensive hyperparameter search of PQCs and NNs with varying numbers of parameters. We confirm that similar to results in classical literature, the architectural choices and hyperparameters contribute more to the agents' success in a RL setting than the number of parameters used in the model. Finally, we show when recent separation results between classical and quantum agents for policy gradient RL can be extended to inferring optimal Q-values in restricted families of environments.",

However, not all domains of machine learning have benefited equally from quantum enhancements. Notably, deep learning and reinforcement learning, despite their tremendous success in the classical domain, both individually and combined, remain relatively unaddressed by the quantum community. Arguably, one reason behind this is the systematic use in these domains of models and methods without prominent computational bottlenecks, leaving little room for quantum improvements. In this work, we study the state-of-the-art neural-network approaches for reinforcement learning with quantum enhancements in mind. We demonstrate the substantial learning advantage that models with a sampling bottleneck can provide over conventional neural network architectures in complex learning environments. These so-called energy-based models, like deep energy-based reinforcement learning, and deep projective simulation that we also introduce in this work, effectively allow to trade off learning performance for efficiency of computation. To alleviate the additional computational costs, we propose to leverage future and near-term quantum algorithms, resulting in overall more advantageous learning algorithms. This is achieved using cutting-edge and new quantum computing machinery to speed-up classical sampling methods and by employing generalized models to gain an additional quantum advantage.",

With the recent development of quantum computing, researchers and tech-giants have attempted new quantum circuits for machine learning tasks. However, the existing quantum computing platforms are hard to simulate classical deep learning models or problems because of the intractability of deep quantum circuits. Thus, it is necessary to design feasible quantum algorithms for quantum machine learning for noisy intermediate scale quantum (NISQ) devices. This work explores variational quantum circuits for deep reinforcement learning. Specifically, we reshape classical deep reinforcement learning algorithms like experience replay and target network into a representation of variational quantum circuits. Moreover, we use a quantum information encoding scheme to reduce the number of model parameters compared to classical neural networks. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first proof-of-principle demonstration of variational quantum circuits to approximate the deep $Q$-value function for decision-making and policy-selection reinforcement learning with experience replay and target network. Besides, our variational quantum circuits can be deployed in many near-term NISQ machines.",

In this paper, we explore the ability of generative adversarial networks (GANs) based on quantum computing. More specifically, we propose a quantum GAN for generating classical discrete distribution, which has a classical-quantum hybrid architecture and is composed of a parameterized quantum circuit as the generator and a classical neural network as the discriminator. The parameterized quantum circuit only consists of simple one-qubit rotation gates and two-qubit controlled-phase gates that are available in current quantum devices. Our scheme has the following characteristics and potential advantages: (i) It is intrinsically capable of generating discrete data (e.g., text data), while classical GANs are clumsy for this task due to the vanishing gradient problem. (ii) Our scheme avoids the input/output bottlenecks embarrassing most of the existing quantum learning algorithms that either require to encode the classical input data into quantum states, or output a quantum state corresponding to the solution instead of giving the solution itself, which inevitably compromises the speedup of the quantum algorithm. (iii) The probability distribution implicitly given by data samples can be loaded into a quantum state, which may be useful for some further applications.",

The realization of the advantage often requires the ability to load classical data efficiently into quantum states. However, the best known methods require $\\mathcal{O}\\left(2^n\\right)$ gates to load an exact representation of a generic data structure into an $n$-qubit state. This scaling can easily predominate the complexity of a quantum algorithm and, thereby, impair potential quantum advantage. Our work presents a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm for efficient, approximate quantum state loading. More precisely, we use quantum Generative Adversarial Networks (qGANs) to facilitate efficient learning and loading of generic probability distributions -- implicitly given by data samples -- into quantum states. Through the interplay of a quantum channel, such as a variational quantum circuit, and a classical neural network, the qGAN can learn a representation of the probability distribution underlying the data samples and load it into a quantum state. The loading requires $\\mathcal{O}\\left(poly\\left(n\\right)\\right)$ gates and can, thus, enable the use of potentially advantageous quantum algorithms, such as Quantum Amplitude Estimation. We implement the qGAN distribution learning and loading method with Qiskit and test it using a quantum simulation as well as actual quantum processors provided by the IBM Q Experience. Furthermore, we employ quantum simulation to demonstrate the use of the trained quantum channel in a quantum finance application.",

In this study, using IBM gate-model quantum computing systems, we employ the quantum variational classifier method in two recent LHC flagship physics analyses: $t\\bar{t}H$ (Higgs boson production in association with a top quark pair) and $H\\rightarrow\\mu^{+}\\mu^{-}$ (Higgs boson decays to two muons, probing the Higgs boson couplings to second-generation fermions). We have obtained early results with 10 qubits on the IBM quantum simulator and the IBM quantum hardware. With small training samples of 100 events on the quantum simulator, the quantum variational classifier method performs similarly to classical algorithms such as SVM (support vector machine) and BDT (boosted decision tree), which are often employed in LHC physics analyses. On the quantum hardware, the quantum variational classifier method has shown promising discrimination power, comparable to that on the quantum simulator.

We propose different implementations of hybrid transfer learning, but we focus mainly on the paradigm in which a pre-trained classical network is modified and augmented by a final variational quantum circuit. This approach is particularly attractive in the current era of intermediate-scale quantum technology since it allows to optimally pre-process high dimensional data (e.g., images) with any state-of-the-art classical network and to embed a select set of highly informative features into a quantum processor. We present several proof-of-concept examples of the convenient application of quantum transfer learning for image recognition and quantum state classification. We use the cross-platform software library PennyLane to experimentally test a high-resolution image classifier with two different quantum computers, respectively provided by IBM and Rigetti.",

A suitable design approach are variational circuits where the parameters of gates are learnt, an approach that is particularly fruitful for applications in machine learning. In this paper, we propose a low-depth variational quantum algorithm for supervised learning. The input feature vectors are encoded into the amplitudes of a quantum system, and a quantum circuit of parametrised single and two-qubit gates together with a single-qubit measurement is used to classify the inputs. This circuit architecture ensures that the number of learnable parameters is poly-logarithmic in the input dimension. We propose a quantum-classical training scheme where the analytical gradients of the model can be estimated by running several slightly adapted versions of the variational circuit. We show with simulations that the circuit-centric quantum classifier performs well on standard classical benchmark datasets while requiring dramatically fewer parameters than other methods. We also evaluate sensitivity of the classification to state preparation and parameter noise, introduce a quantum version of dropout regularisation and provide a graphical representation of quantum gates as highly symmetric linear layers of a neural network.",

We test the method by simulating the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process and sampling at times different from the initial point, as required in financial analysis and dataset augmentation. Additionally, we analyse continuous quantum generative adversarial networks (qGANs), and show that they represent quantile functions with a modified (reordered) shape that impedes their efficient time-propagation.

For quantum systems, where the dimension of the problem space grows exponentially, finding the eigenvalues of certain operators is one such intractable problem and remains a fundamental challenge. The quantum phase estimation algorithm can efficiently find the eigenvalue of a given eigenvector but requires fully coherent evolution. We present an alternative approach that greatly reduces the requirements for coherent evolution and we combine this method with a new approach to state preparation based on ans\u00e4tze and classical optimization. We have implemented the algorithm by combining a small-scale photonic quantum processor with a conventional computer.

Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs), which use a classical optimizer to train a parametrized quantum circuit, have emerged as a leading strategy to address these constraints. VQAs have now been proposed for essentially all applications that researchers have envisioned for quantum computers, and they appear to the best hope for obtaining quantum advantage.

Several methods are known which achieve this goal, namely Standard Quantum Process Tomography (SQPT), Ancilla-Assisted Process Tomography (AAPT), and the recently proposed scheme of Direct Characterization of Quantum Dynamics (DCQD). Here, we review these schemes and analyze them with respect to some of the physical resources they require. Although a reliable figure-of-merit for process characterization is not yet available, our analysis can provide a benchmark which is necessary for choosing the scheme that is the most appropriate in a given situation, with given resources. As a result, we conclude that for quantum systems where two-body interactions are not naturally available, SQPT is the most efficient scheme. However, for quantum systems with controllable two-body interactions, the DCQD scheme is more efficient than other known QPT schemes in terms of the total number of required elementary quantum operations.",

The conventional method uses standard quantum process tomography, which requires $d^2$ input states and $d^4$ quantum measurements for a $d$-dimensional Hilbert space. These experimental requirements are compounded by the complexity of processing the collected data, which can take several orders of magnitude longer than the experiment itself. In this paper we propose an alternative self-guided algorithm for quantum process tomography, tuned for the task of finding an unknown unitary process. Our algorithm is a fully automated and adaptive process characterization technique. The advantages of our algorithm are: inherent robustness to both statistical and technical noise; requires less space and time since there is no post-processing of the data; requires only a single input state and measurement; and, provides on-the-fly diagnostic information while the experiment is running. Numerical results show our algorithm achieves the same $1/n$ scaling as standard quantum process tomography when $n$ uses of the unknown process are used. We also present experimental results wherein the algorithm, and its advantages, are realized for the task of finding an element of $SU(2)$.",

It is therefore a question whether our intuition is the best way to find new experiments. Here we report the development of the computer algorithm Melvin which is able to find new experimental implementations for the creation and manipulation of complex quantum states. And indeed, the discovered experiments extensively use unfamiliar and asymmetric techniques which are challenging to understand intuitively. The results range from the first implementation of a high-dimensional Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state, to a vast variety of experiments for asymmetrically entangled quantum states -- a feature that can only exist when both the number of involved parties and dimensions is larger than 2. Additionally, new types of high-dimensional transformations are found that perform cyclic operations. Melvin autonomously learns from solutions for simpler systems, which significantly speeds up the discovery rate of more complex experiments. The ability to automate the design of a quantum experiment can be applied to many quantum systems and allows the physical realization of quantum states previously thought of only on paper.",

Crossbar arrays of resistive memory devices can be used to encode the network weights and perform efficient analog matrix-vector multiplications without intermediate movements of data. However, due to device variability and noise, the network needs to be trained in a specific way so that transferring the digitally trained weights to the analog resistive memory devices will not result in significant loss of accuracy. Here, we introduce a methodology to train ResNet-type convolutional neural networks that results in no appreciable accuracy loss when transferring weights to in-memory computing hardware based on phase-change memory (PCM). We also propose a compensation technique that exploits the batch normalization parameters to improve the accuracy retention over time. We achieve a classification accuracy of 93.7% on the CIFAR-10 dataset and a top-1 accuracy on the ImageNet benchmark of 71.6% after mapping the trained weights to PCM. Our hardware results on CIFAR-10 with ResNet-32 demonstrate an accuracy above 93.5% retained over a one day period, where each of the 361,722 synaptic weights of the network is programmed on just two PCM devices organized in a differential configuration.",

One of the benefits of converting CNNs to spiking CNNs is to leverage the sparse computation of SNNs and consequently perform equivalent computation at a lower energy consumption.

Real-world quantum annealing-based solvers require a combination of annealing and classical pre- and post-processing; at this early stage, little is known about how to partition and optimize the processing. This article presents an experimental case study of quantum annealing and some of the factors involved in real-world solvers, using a 504-qubit D-Wave Two machine and the graph isomorphism problem. To illustrate the role of classical pre-processing, a compact Hamiltonian is presented that enables a reduced Ising model for each problem instance. On random N-vertex graphs, the median number of variables is reduced from N^2 to fewer than N lg N and solvable graph sizes increase from N = 5 to N = 13. Additionally, a type of classical post-processing error correction is evaluated. While the solution times are not competitive with classical approaches to graph isomorphism, the enhanced solver ultimately classified correctly every problem that was mapped to the processor and demonstrated clear advantages over the baseline approach. The results shed some light on the nature of real-world quantum annealing and the associated hybrid classical-quantum solvers.",

Among others, an important goal is the minimization of the total transit time of the passengers. The corresponding objective function is quadratic in the binary decision variables encoding the flight-to-gate assignment. Hence, it is a quadratic assignment problem being hard to solve in general. In this work we investigate the solvability of this problem with a D-Wave quantum annealer. These machines are optimizers for quadratic unconstrained optimization problems (QUBO). Therefore the flight gate assignment problem seems to be well suited for these machines. We use real world data from a mid-sized German airport as well as simulation based data to extract typical instances small enough to be amenable to the D-Wave machine. In order to mitigate precision problems, we employ bin packing on the passenger numbers to reduce the precision requirements of the extracted instances. We find that, for the instances we investigated, the bin packing has little effect on the solution quality. Hence, we were able to solve small problem instances extracted from real data with the D-Wave 2000Q quantum annealer.",

Our motivation was to cast the training of a classifier into a format amenable to solution by the quantum adiabatic algorithm. Applying adiabatic quantum computing (AQC) promises to yield solutions that are superior to those which can be achieved with classical heuristic solvers. Interestingly we found that by using heuristic solvers to obtain approximate solutions we could already gain an advantage over the standard method AdaBoost. In this communication we generalize the baseline method to large scale classifier training. By large scale we mean that either the cardinality of the dictionary of candidate weak classifiers or the number of weak learners used in the strong classifier exceed the number of variables that can be handled effectively in a single global optimization. For such situations we propose an iterative and piecewise approach in which a subset of weak classifiers is selected in each iteration via global optimization. The strong classifier is then constructed by concatenating the subsets of weak classifiers. We show in numerical studies that the generalized method again successfully competes with AdaBoost. We also provide theoretical arguments as to why the proposed optimization method, which does not only minimize the empirical loss but also adds L0-norm regularization, is superior to versions of boosting that only minimize the empirical loss. By conducting a Quantum Monte Carlo simulation we gather evidence that the quantum adiabatic algorithm is able to handle a generic training problem efficiently.",

The term synchronisation refers to the property that the set of pairwise matchings is cycle-consistent, i.e. in the full matching case all compositions of pairwise matchings over cycles must be equal to the identity. Motivated by clustering and matrix factorisation perspectives of cycle-consistency, we derive an algorithm to tackle the permutation synchronisation problem based on non-negative factorisations. In order to deal with the inherent non-convexity of the permutation synchronisation problem, we use an initialisation procedure based on a novel rotation scheme applied to the solution of the spectral relaxation. Moreover, this rotation scheme facilitates a convenient Euclidean projection to obtain a binary solution after solving our relaxed problem. In contrast to state-of-the-art methods, our approach is guaranteed to produce cycle-consistent results. We experimentally demonstrate the efficacy of our method and show that it achieves better results compared to existing methods.",

Yet, differing from real neural tissue, traditional computing architectures physically separate the core computing functions of memory and processing, making fast, efficient and low-energy brain-like computing difficult to achieve. To overcome such limitations, an attractive and alternative goal is to design direct hardware mimics of brain neurons and synapses which, when connected in appropriate networks (or neuromorphic systems), process information in a way more fundamentally analogous to that of real brains. Here we present an all-optical approach to achieving such a goal. Specifically, we demonstrate an all-optical spiking neuron device and connect it, via an integrated photonics network, to photonic synapses to deliver a small-scale all-optical neurosynaptic system capable of supervised and unsupervised learning. Moreover, we exploit wavelength division multiplexing techniques to implement a scalable circuit architecture for photonic neural networks, successfully demonstrating pattern recognition directly in the optical domain using a photonic system comprising 140 elements. Such optical implementations of neurosynaptic networks promise access to the high speed and bandwidth inherent to optical systems, which would be very attractive for the direct processing of telecommunication and visual data in the optical domain.",

However, efforts have largely been invested in implementations in the electrical domain with potential limitations of switching speed, packing density of large integrated systems and interconnect losses. As an alternative, neuromorphic engineering in the photonic domain has recently gained attention. In this work, we demonstrate a purely photonic operation of an Integrate-and-Fire Spiking neuron, based on the phase change dynamics of Ge$_2$Sb$_2$Te$_5$ (GST) embedded on top of a microring resonator, which alleviates the energy constraints of PCMs in electrical domain. We also show that such a neuron can be potentially integrated with on-chip synapses into an all-Photonic Spiking Neural network inferencing framework which promises to be ultrafast and can potentially offer a large operating bandwidth.",

These achievements are the culmination of decades-long research into better training techniques and deeper neural network models, as well as improvements in hardware platforms that are used to train and execute the deep neural network models. Many application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) hardware accelerators for deep learning have garnered interest in recent years due to their improved performance and energy-efficiency over conventional CPU and GPU architectures. However, these accelerators are constrained by fundamental bottlenecks due to 1) the slowdown in CMOS scaling, which has limited computational and performance-per-watt capabilities of emerging electronic processors, and 2) the use of metallic interconnects for data movement, which do not scale well and are a major cause of bandwidth, latency, and energy inefficiencies in almost every contemporary processor. Silicon photonics has emerged as a promising CMOS-compatible alternative to realize a new generation of deep learning accelerators that can use light for both communication and computation. This article surveys the landscape of silicon photonics to accelerate deep learning, with a coverage of developments across design abstractions in a bottom-up manner, to convey both the capabilities and limitations of the silicon photonics paradigm in the context of deep learning acceleration.",

Approaches that use traditional electronic devices to create artificial neurons and synapses are, however, currently limited by the energy and area requirements of these components. Spintronic nanodevices, which exploit both the magnetic and electrical properties of electrons, can increase the energy efficiency and decrease the area of these circuits, and magnetic tunnel junctions are of particular interest as neuromorphic computing elements because they are compatible with standard integrated circuits and can support multiple functionalities. Here we review the development of spintronic devices for neuromorphic computing. We examine how magnetic tunnel junctions can serve as synapses and neurons, and how magnetic textures, such as domain walls and skyrmions, can function as neurons. We also explore spintronics-based implementations of neuromorphic computing tasks, such as pattern recognition in an associative memory, and discuss the challenges that exist in scaling up these systems.",

The algorithm depends on a positive integer p and the quality of the approximation improves as p is increased. The quantum circuit that implements the algorithm consists of unitary gates whose locality is at most the locality of the objective function whose optimum is sought. The depth of the circuit grows linearly with p times (at worst) the number of constraints. If p is fixed, that is, independent of the input size, the algorithm makes use of efficient classical preprocessing. If p grows with the input size a different strategy is proposed. We study the algorithm as applied to MaxCut on regular graphs and analyze its performance on 2-regular and 3-regular graphs for fixed p. For p = 1, on 3-regular graphs the quantum algorithm always finds a cut that is at least 0.6924 times the size of the optimal cut.",

Specifically, we realize the controlled-phase gate, enacted by a novel, fast protocol involving only global coupling of two qubits to Rydberg states. We benchmark this operation by preparing Bell states with fidelity $\\mathcal{F} \\ge 95.0(2)\\%$, and extract gate fidelity $\\ge 97.4(3)\\%,$ averaged across five atom pairs. In addition, we report a proof-of-principle implementation of the three-qubit Toffoli gate, in which two control atoms simultaneously constrain the behavior of one target atom.

This approach is both straightforward and surprisingly efficient. We show that by simply randomizing how the summands are ordered, one can prove stronger bounds on the quality of approximation for product formulas of any given order, and thereby give more efficient simulations. Indeed, we show that these bounds can be asymptotically better than previous bounds that exploit commutation between the summands, despite using much less information about the structure of the Hamiltonian.

For near-term hardware, with only limited means to mitigate decoherence, it is critical to minimize the duration of the circuit. We investigate the application of temporal planners to the problem of compiling quantum circuits to newly emerging quantum hardware. While our approach is general, we focus on compiling to superconducting hardware architectures with nearest neighbor constraints. Our initial experiments focus on compiling Quantum Alternating Operator Ansatz (QAOA) circuits whose high number of commuting gates allow great flexibility in the order in which the gates can be applied. That freedom makes it more challenging to find optimal compilations but also means there is a greater potential win from more optimized compilation than for less flexible circuits. We map this quantum circuit compilation problem to a temporal planning problem, and generated a test suite of compilation problems for QAOA circuits of various sizes to a realistic hardware architecture. We report compilation results from several state-of-the-art temporal planners on this test set. This early empirical evaluation demonstrates that temporal planning is a viable approach to quantum circuit compilation.",

This attack uses $O(\\sqrt{N})$ calls to the cipher to search a key space of size $N$. Previous work in the specific case of AES derived the full gate cost by analyzing quantum circuits for the cipher, but focused on minimizing the number of qubits. In contrast, we study the cost of quantum key search attacks under a depth restriction and introduce techniques that reduce the oracle depth, even if it requires more qubits. As cases in point, we design quantum circuits for the block ciphers AES and LowMC. Our circuits give a lower overall attack cost in both the gate count and depth-times-width cost models. In NIST's post-quantum cryptography standardization process, security categories are defined based on the concrete cost of quantum key search against AES. We present new, lower cost estimates for each category, so our work has immediate implications for the security assessment of post-quantum cryptography. As part of this work, we release Q# implementations of the full Grover oracle for AES-128, -192, -256 and for the three LowMC instantiations used in Picnic, including unit tests and code to reproduce our quantum resource estimates. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first two such full implementations and automatic resource estimations.",

Yet any level of abstraction away from the underlying hardware incurs overhead. In the era of near-term, noisy, intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) hardware with severely restricted resources, this overhead may be unjustifiable. In this work, we develop quantum algorithms for Hamiltonian simulation \"one level below\" the circuit model, exploiting the underlying control over qubit interactions available in principle in most quantum hardware implementations. We then analyse the impact of these techniques under the standard error model where errors occur per gate, and an error model with a constant error rate per unit time.\nTo quantify the benefits of this approach, we apply it to a canonical example: time-dynamics simulation of the 2D spin Fermi-Hubbard model. We derive analytic circuit identities for efficiently synthesising multi-qubit evolutions from two-qubit interactions. Combined with new error bounds for Trotter product formulas tailored to the non-asymptotic regime and a careful analysis of error propagation under the aforementioned per-gate and per-time error models, we improve upon the previous best methods for Hamiltonian simulation by multiple orders of magnitude. By our calculations, for a 5$\\mathbf\\times$5 Fermi-Hubbard lattice we reduce the circuit depth from 800,160 to 1460 in the per-gate error model, or the circuit-depth-equivalent to 440 in the per-time error model. This brings Hamiltonian simulation, previously beyond reach of current hardware for non-trivial examples, significantly closer to being feasible in the NISQ era.",

In this context, simulations of the Hubbard and plane-wave electronic structure models with $N < 10^5$ fermionic modes can be performed with roughly $O(1)$ and $O(N^2)$ T complexities. We perform numerics revealing tradeoffs between the error and gate complexity of a Trotter step; e.g., we show that split-operator techniques have less Trotter error than popular alternatives. By compiling to surface code fault-tolerant gates and assuming error rates of one part per thousand, we show that one can error-correct quantum simulations of interesting, classically intractable instances with a few hundred thousand physical qubits.",

While it is reasonable to expect this complexity---in particular, this was claimed without rigorous justification by Jordan, Lee, and Preskill---we are not aware of a straightforward proof. Our approach is based on an analysis of the local error structure of product formulas, as introduced by Descombes and Thalhammer and further simplified here. We prove error bounds for canonical product formulas, which include well-known constructions such as the Lie-Trotter-Suzuki formulas.

The majority of quantum algorithms for this problem encode the wavefunction using $N$ Gaussian orbitals, leading to Hamiltonians with ${\\cal O}(N^4)$ second-quantized terms. We avoid this overhead and extend methods to the condensed phase by utilizing a dual form of the plane wave basis which diagonalizes the potential operator, leading to a Hamiltonian representation with ${\\cal O}(N^2)$ second-quantized terms. Using this representation we can implement single Trotter steps of the Hamiltonians with linear gate depth on a planar lattice. Properties of the basis allow us to deploy Trotter and Taylor series based simulations with respective circuit depths of ${\\cal O}(N^{7/2})$ and $\\widetilde{\\cal O}(N^{8/3})$ for fixed charge densities - both are large asymptotic improvements over all prior results. Variational algorithms also require significantly fewer measurements to find the mean energy in this basis, ameliorating a primary challenge of that approach. We conclude with a proposal to simulate the uniform electron gas (jellium) using a low depth variational ansatz realizable on near-term quantum devices.

We improve an existing algorithm to prepare an arbitrary Slater determinant by exploiting a unitary symmetry. We also present a quantum algorithm to prepare an arbitrary fermionic Gaussian state with $O(N^2)$ gates and $O(N)$ circuit depth. Both algorithms are optimal in the sense that the numbers of parameters in the quantum circuits are equal to those to describe the quantum states. Furthermore, we propose an algorithm to implement the 2-dimensional (2D) fermionic Fourier transformation on a 2D qubit array with only $O(N^{1.5})$ gates and $O(\\sqrt N)$ circuit depth, which is the minimum depth required for quantum information to travel across the qubit array.

To address this discrepancy, a quantum-classical hybrid optimization scheme known as \"the quantum variational eigensolver\" was developed with the philosophy that even minimal quantum resources could be made useful when used in conjunction with classical routines. In this work we extend the general theory of this algorithm and suggest algorithmic improvements for practical implementations. Specifically, we develop a variational adiabatic ansatz and explore unitary coupled cluster where we establish a connection from second order unitary coupled cluster to universal gate sets through relaxation of exponential splitting. We introduce the concept of quantum variational error suppression that allows some errors to be suppressed naturally in this algorithm on a pre-threshold quantum device. Additionally, we analyze truncation and correlated sampling in Hamiltonian averaging as ways to reduce the cost of this procedure. Finally, we show how the use of modern derivative free optimization techniques can offer dramatic computational savings of up to three orders of magnitude over previously used optimization techniques.",

In this work, we propose a novel on-chip learning framework to release the full potential of ONNs for power-efficient in situ training. Instead of deploying implementation-costly back-propagation, we directly optimize the device configurations with computation budgets and power constraints. We are the first to model the ONN on-chip learning as a resource-constrained stochastic noisy zeroth-order optimization problem, and propose a novel mixed-training strategy with two-level sparsity and power-aware dynamic pruning to offer a scalable on-chip training solution in practical ONN deployment. Compared with previous methods, we are the first to optimize over 2,500 optical components on chip.

To this end, two fundamental issues are yet to be addressed. The first one is how to implement the back propagation when neuronal activations are discrete. The second one is how to remove the full-precision hidden weights in the training phase to break the bottlenecks of memory/computation consumption. To address the first issue, we present a multi-step neuronal activation discretization method and a derivative approximation technique that enable the implementing the back propagation algorithm on discrete DNNs. While for the second issue, we propose a discrete state transition (DST) methodology to constrain the weights in a discrete space without saving the hidden weights. Through this way, we build a unified framework that subsumes the binary or ternary networks as its special cases, and under which a heuristic algorithm is provided at the website this https URL. More particularly, we find that when both the weights and activations become ternary values, the DNNs can be reduced to sparse binary networks, termed as gated XNOR networks (GXNOR-Nets) since only the event of non-zero weight and non-zero activation enables the control gate to start the XNOR logic operations in the original binary networks. This promises the event-driven hardware design for efficient mobile intelligence. We achieve advanced performance compared with state-of-the-art algorithms. Furthermore, the computational sparsity and the number of states in the discrete space can be flexibly modified to make it suitable for various hardware platforms.",

Of particular interest are artificial neural networks, since matrix-vector multi- plications, which are used heavily in artificial neural networks, can be done efficiently in photonic circuits. The training of an artificial neural network is a crucial step in its application. However, currently on the integrated photonics platform there is no efficient protocol for the training of these networks. In this work, we introduce a method that enables highly efficient, in situ training of a photonic neural network. We use adjoint variable methods to derive the photonic analogue of the backpropagation algorithm, which is the standard method for computing gradients of conventional neural networks. We further show how these gradients may be obtained exactly by performing intensity measurements within the device. As an application, we demonstrate the training of a numerically simulated photonic artificial neural network. Beyond the training of photonic machine learning implementations, our method may also be of broad interest to experimental sensitivity analysis of photonic systems and the optimization of reconfigurable optics platforms.",

In this article, we propose a novel learning strategy based on neuroevolution to design and train the ONNs. Two typical neuroevolution algorithms are used to determine the hyper-parameters of the ONNs and to optimize the weights (phase shifters) in the connections. In order to demonstrate the effectiveness of the training algorithms, the trained ONNs are applied in the classification tasks for iris plants dataset, wine recognition dataset and modulation formats recognition. The calculated results exhibit that the training algorithms based on neuroevolution are competitive with other traditional learning algorithms on both accuracy and stability.

Significant effort has been made to develop electronic architectures tuned to implement artificial neural networks that improve upon both computational speed and energy efficiency.

An important class of such operations are {\\em transversal}, acting bitwise between corresponding qubits in each code block, thus allowing error propagation to be carefully limited. If any quantum operation could be implemented using a set of such gates, the set would be {\\em universal}; codes with such a universal, transversal gate set have been widely desired for efficient fault-tolerant quantum computation. We study the structure of GF(4)-additive quantum codes and prove that no universal set of transversal logic operations exists for these codes.

                        "Citation Paper Abstract": "Abstract:In this letter, we investigate whether the use of artificial noise (AN) is helpful to enhance the secrecy rate of an intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) assisted wireless communication system. Specifically, an IRS is deployed nearby a single-antenna receiver to assist in the transmission from a multi-antenna transmitter, in the presence of multiple single-antenna eavesdroppers. Aiming to maximize the achievable secrecy rate, a design problem for jointly optimizing transmit beamforming with AN or jamming and IRS reflect beamforming is formulated, which is however difficult to solve due to its non-convexity and coupled variables. We thus propose an efficient algorithm based on alternating optimization to solve the problem sub-optimally. Simulation results show that incorporating AN in transmit beamforming is beneficial under the new setup with IRS reflect beamforming. In particular, it is unveiled that the IRS-aided design without AN even performs worse than the AN-aided design without IRS as the number of eavesdroppers near the IRS increases.",

As an illustration of our method we implemented this algorithm and found factorizations of the commonly used quantum logical operations into elementary gates in the Clifford+T set. In particular, we report a decomposition of the Toffoli gate over the set of Clifford and T gates. Our decomposition achieves a total T-depth of 3, thereby providing a 40% reduction over the previously best known decomposition for the Toffoli gate. Due to the size of the search space the algorithm is only practical for small parameters, such as the number of qubits, and the number of gates in an optimal implementation.",

The read and write processes of DNA storage are error-prone. Images widely used in social media have the properties of fault tolerance which are well fitted to the DNA storage. However, prior work simply investigated the feasibility of DNA storage storing different types of data and simply store images in DNA storage, which did not fully investigate the fault-tolerant potential of images in the DNA storage. In this paper, we proposed a new image-based DNA system called IMG-DNA, which can efficiently store images in DNA storage with improved DNA storage robustness. First, a new DNA architecture is proposed to fit JPEG-based images and improve the image's robustness in DNA storage. Moreover, barriers inserted in DNA sequences efficiently prevent error propagation in images of DNA storage. The experimental results indicate that the proposed IMG-DNA achieves much higher fault-tolerant than prior work.",

                        "Citation Paper Abstract": "Abstract:With growing model complexity, mapping Spiking Neural Network (SNN)-based applications to tile-based neuromorphic hardware is becoming increasingly challenging. This is because the synaptic storage resources on a tile, viz. a crossbar, can accommodate only a fixed number of pre-synaptic connections per post-synaptic neuron. For complex SNN models that have many pre-synaptic connections per neuron, some connections may need to be pruned after training to fit onto the tile resources, leading to a loss in model quality, e.g., accuracy. In this work, we propose a novel unrolling technique that decomposes a neuron function with many pre-synaptic connections into a sequence of homogeneous neural units, where each neural unit is a function computation node, with two pre-synaptic connections. This spatial decomposition technique significantly improves crossbar utilization and retains all pre-synaptic connections, resulting in no loss of the model quality derived from connection pruning. We integrate the proposed technique within an existing SNN mapping framework and evaluate it using machine learning applications on the DYNAP-SE state-of-the-art neuromorphic hardware. Our results demonstrate an average 60% lower crossbar requirement, 9x higher synapse utilization, 62% lower wasted energy on the hardware, and between 0.8% and 4.6% increase in model quality.",

Dynamically remapping logical qubits to physical qubits in the compiler is needed to enable the two-qubit gates in the algorithm, which introduces additional operations and inevitably reduces the fidelity of the algorithm. Previous solutions in finding such remapping suffer from high complexity, poor initial mapping quality, and limited flexibility and controllability.\nTo address these drawbacks mentioned above, this paper proposes a SWAP-based BidiREctional heuristic search algorithm SABRE, which is applicable to NISQ devices with arbitrary connections between qubits. By optimizing every search attempt,globally optimizing the initial mapping using a novel reverse traversal technique, introducing the decay effect to enable the trade-off between the depth and the number of gates of the entire algorithm, SABRE outperforms the best known algorithm with exponential speedup and comparable or better results on various benchmarks.",

Here we introduce the latest release of Intel Quantum Simulator (IQS), formerly known as qHiPSTER. The high-performance computing (HPC) capability of the software allows users to leverage the available hardware resources provided by supercomputers, as well as available public cloud computing infrastructure. To take advantage of the latter platform, together with the distributed simulation of each separate quantum state, IQS allows to subdivide the computational resources to simulate a pool of related circuits in parallel. We highlight the technical implementation of the distributed algorithm and details about the new pool functionality. We also include some basic benchmarks (up to 42 qubits) and performance results obtained using HPC infrastructure. Finally, we use IQS to emulate a scenario in which many quantum devices are running in parallel to implement the quantum approximate optimization algorithm, using particle swarm optimization as the classical subroutine. The results demonstrate that the hyperparameters of this classical optimization algorithm depends on the total number of quantum circuit simulations one has the bandwidth to perform. Intel Quantum Simulator has been released open-source with permissive licensing and is designed to simulate a large number of qubits, to emulate multiple quantum devices running in parallel, and/or to study the effects of decoherence and other hardware errors on calculation results.",

To date, almost all quantum-metrology demonstrations are restricted to improving the measurement performance at a single sensor, but a plethora of applications require multiple sensors that work jointly to tackle distributed sensing problems. Here, we propose and experimentally demonstrate a reconfigurable sensor network empowered by continuous-variable (CV) multipartite entanglement. Our experiment establishes a connection between the entanglement structure and the achievable quantum advantage in different distributed sensing problems. The demonstrated entangled sensor network is composed of three sensor nodes each equipped with an electro-optic transducer for the detection of radiofrequency (RF) signals. By properly tailoring the CV multipartite entangled states, the entangled sensor network can be reconfigured to maximize the quantum advantage in distributed RF sensing problems such as measuring the angle of arrival of an RF field. The rich physics of CV multipartite entanglement unveiled by our work would open a new avenue for distributed quantum sensing and would lead to applications in ultrasensitive positioning, navigation, and timing.",

We see that there is no clear consensus but each system has one or more of the following features:(1) Analog computing (2) Non vonNeumann Architecture and low-precision digital processing (3) Spiking Neural Networks (SNN) with components closely related to biology. We compare recent machine learning accelerator chips to show that indeed analog processing and reduced bit precision architectures have best throughput, energy and area efficiencies. However, pure digital architectures can also achieve quite high efficiencies by just adopting a non von-Neumann architecture. Given the design automation tools for digital hardware design, it raises a question on the likelihood of adoption of analog processing in the near future for industrial designs. Next, we argue about the importance of defining standards and choosing proper benchmarks for the progress of neuromorphic system designs and propose some desired characteristics of such benchmarks. Finally, we show brain-machine interfaces as a potential task that fulfils all the criteria of such benchmarks.",

They have been shown to be effective in special-purpose accelerators for a limited set of neural network applications.\nWe present the Programmable Ultra-efficient Memristor-based Accelerator (PUMA) which enhances memristor crossbars with general purpose execution units to enable the acceleration of a wide variety of Machine Learning (ML) inference workloads. PUMA's microarchitecture techniques exposed through a specialized Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) retain the efficiency of in-memory computing and analog circuitry, without compromising programmability.\nWe also present the PUMA compiler which translates high-level code to PUMA ISA. The compiler partitions the computational graph and optimizes instruction scheduling and register allocation to generate code for large and complex workloads to run on thousands of spatial cores.\nWe have developed a detailed architecture simulator that incorporates the functionality, timing, and power models of PUMA's components to evaluate performance and energy consumption. A PUMA accelerator running at 1 GHz can reach area and power efficiency of $577~GOPS/s/mm^2$ and $837~GOPS/s/W$, respectively. Our evaluation of diverse ML applications from image recognition, machine translation, and language modelling (5M-800M synapses) shows that PUMA achieves up to $2,446\\times$ energy and $66\\times$ latency improvement for inference compared to state-of-the-art GPUs. Compared to an application-specific memristor-based accelerator, PUMA incurs small energy overheads at similar inference latency and added programmability.",

A python wrapper is developed to interface NeuroSim with a popular machine learning platform: Pytorch, to support flexible network structures. The framework provides automatic algorithm-to-hardware mapping, and evaluates chip-level area, energy efficiency and throughput for training or inference, as well as training/inference accuracy with hardware constraints. Our prior work (DNN+NeuroSim V1.1) was developed to estimate the impact of reliability in synaptic devices, and analog-to-digital converter (ADC) quantization loss on the accuracy and hardware performance of inference engines. In this work, we further investigated the impact of the analog emerging non-volatile memory non-ideal device properties for on-chip training. By introducing the nonlinearity, asymmetry, device-to-device and cycle-to-cycle variation of weight update into the python wrapper, and peripheral circuits for error/weight gradient computation in NeuroSim core, we benchmarked CIM accelerators based on state-of-the-art SRAM and eNVM devices for VGG-8 on CIFAR-10 dataset, revealing the crucial specs of synaptic devices for on-chip training.

Unfortunately, most generic object trackers are still trained from scratch online and do not benefit from the large number of videos that are readily available for offline training. We propose a method for offline training of neural networks that can track novel objects at test-time at 100 fps. Our tracker is significantly faster than previous methods that use neural networks for tracking, which are typically very slow to run and not practical for real-time applications. Our tracker uses a simple feed-forward network with no online training required. The tracker learns a generic relationship between object motion and appearance and can be used to track novel objects that do not appear in the training set. We test our network on a standard tracking benchmark to demonstrate our tracker's state-of-the-art performance. Further, our performance improves as we add more videos to our offline training set. To the best of our knowledge, our tracker is the first neural-network tracker that learns to track generic objects at 100 fps.",

To facilitate the trend and produce ever smaller, faster and cheaper computing devices, the size of nanoelectronic devices is now reaching the scale of atoms or molecules - a technical goal undoubtedly demanding for novel devices. Following the trend, we explore an unconventional route of implementing a reservoir computing on a single protein molecule and introduce neuromorphic connectivity with a small-world networking property. We have chosen Izhikevich spiking neurons as elementary processors, corresponding to the atoms of verotoxin protein, and its molecule as a 'hardware' architecture of the communication networks connecting the processors. We apply on a single readout layer various training methods in a supervised fashion to investigate whether the molecular structured Reservoir Computing (RC) system is capable to deal with machine learning benchmarks. We start with the Remote Supervised Method, based on Spike-Timing-Dependent-Plasticity, and carry on with linear regression and scaled conjugate gradient back-propagation training methods. The RC network is evaluated as a proof-of-concept on the handwritten digit images from the MNIST dataset and demonstrates acceptable classification accuracy in comparison with other similar approaches.",

The future internet will be a global system of various packet switching quantum and classical networks and we call it \\emph{quantum internet}. To build a quantum internet, unified protocols that support the distribution of quantum messages within it are necessary. Intuitively one would extend classical internet protocols to handle quantum messages. However, classical network mechanisms, especially those related to error control and reliable connection, implicitly assume that information can be duplicated, which is not true in the quantum world due to the no-cloning theorem and monogamy of entanglement. In this paper, we investigate and propose protocols for packet quantum network intercommunication. To handle the packet loss problem in transport, we propose a quantum retransmission protocol based on the recursive use of a quantum secret sharing scheme. Other internet protocols are also discussed. In particular, the creation of logical process-to-process connections is accomplished by a quantum version of the three-way handshake protocol.",

These quantum devices will not likely be universal or fully programmable, but special-purpose processors whose hardware will be tightly co-designed with particular target applications. Trapped atomic ions are a leading platform for first generation quantum computers, but are also fundamentally scalable to more powerful general purpose devices in future generations. This is because trapped ion qubits are atomic clock standards that can be made identical to a part in 10^15, and their quantum circuit connectivity can be reconfigured through the use of external fields, without modifying the arrangement or architecture of the qubits themselves. In this article we show how a modular quantum computer of any size can be engineered from ion crystals, and how the wiring between ion trap qubits can be tailored to a variety of applications and quantum computing protocols.",

Optimizing both of them simultaneously is a difficult problem due to their intrinsic trade-off. Inspired by the application-specific design principle, this paper proposes an automatic design flow to generate simplified superconducting quantum processor architecture with negligible performance loss for different quantum programs. Our architecture-design-oriented profiling method identifies program components and patterns critical to both the performance and the yield rate. A follow-up hardware design flow decomposes the complicated design procedure into three subroutines, each of which focuses on different hardware components and cooperates with corresponding profiling results and physical constraints. Experimental results show that our design methodology could outperform IBM's general-purpose design schemes with better Pareto-optimal results.",

Examples include calculating molecular and nuclear structure, simulating strongly-interacting electron systems, and modeling aspects of material function. While substantial theoretical advances have been made in mapping these problems to quantum algorithms, there remains a large gap between the resource requirements for solving such problems and the capabilities of currently available quantum hardware. Bridging this gap will require a co-design approach, where the expression of algorithms is developed in conjunction with the hardware itself to optimize execution. Here, we describe a scalable co-design framework for solving chemistry problems on a trapped ion quantum computer, and apply it to compute the ground-state energy of the water molecule. The robust operation of the trapped ion quantum computer yields energy estimates with errors approaching the chemical accuracy, which is the target threshold necessary for predicting the rates of chemical reaction dynamics.",

Such hybrid quantum-classical algorithms are popular for applications in quantum simulation, optimization, and machine learning. Due to its simplicity and hardware efficiency, random circuits are often proposed as initial guesses for exploring the space of quantum states. We show that the exponential dimension of Hilbert space and the gradient estimation complexity make this choice unsuitable for hybrid quantum-classical algorithms run on more than a few qubits. Specifically, we show that for a wide class of reasonable parameterized quantum circuits, the probability that the gradient along any reasonable direction is non-zero to some fixed precision is exponentially small as a function of the number of qubits. We argue that this is related to the 2-design characteristic of random circuits, and that solutions to this problem must be studied.",

Finding exact numerical solutions to these interacting fermion problems has exponential cost, while Monte Carlo methods are plagued by the fermionic sign problem. These limitations of classical computational methods have made even few-atom molecular structures problems of practical interest for medium-sized quantum computers. Yet, thus far experimental implementations have been restricted to molecules involving only Period I elements. Here, we demonstrate the experimental optimization of up to six-qubit Hamiltonian problems with over a hundred Pauli terms, determining the ground state energy for molecules of increasing size, up to BeH2. This is enabled by a hardware-efficient variational quantum eigensolver with trial states specifically tailored to the available interactions in our quantum processor, combined with a compact encoding of fermionic Hamiltonians and a robust stochastic optimization routine. We further demonstrate the flexibility of our approach by applying the technique to a problem of quantum magnetism. Across all studied problems, we find agreement between experiment and numerical simulations with a noisy model of the device. These results help elucidate the requirements for scaling the method to larger systems, and aim at bridging the gap between problems at the forefront of high-performance computing and their implementation on quantum hardware.",

For quantum systems, where the dimension of the problem space grows exponentially, finding the eigenvalues of certain operators is one such intractable problem and remains a fundamental challenge.

We have implemented the algorithm by combining a small-scale photonic quantum processor with a conventional computer.

In particular, mixed precision networks achieve better performance than networks with homogeneous bitwidth for the same size constraint. Since choosing the optimal bitwidths is not straight forward, training methods, which can learn them, are desirable. Differentiable quantization with straight-through gradients allows to learn the quantizer's parameters using gradient methods. We show that a suited parametrization of the quantizer is the key to achieve a stable training and a good final performance. Specifically, we propose to parametrize the quantizer with the step size and dynamic range. The bitwidth can then be inferred from them. Other parametrizations, which explicitly use the bitwidth, consistently perform worse. We confirm our findings with experiments on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet and we obtain mixed precision DNNs with learned quantization parameters, achieving state-of-the-art performance.",

These developments are pushing the limits of existing computing paradigms, and highly parallelized, fast and scalable hardware concepts are becoming progressively more important. Here, we demonstrate a computational specific integrated photonic tensor core - the optical analog of an ASIC-capable of operating at Tera-Multiply-Accumulate per second (TMAC/s) speeds. The photonic core achieves parallelized photonic in-memory computing using phase-change memory arrays and photonic chip-based optical frequency combs (soliton microcombs). The computation is reduced to measuring the optical transmission of reconfigurable and non-resonant passive components and can operate at a bandwidth exceeding 14 GHz, limited only by the speed of the modulators and photodetectors. Given recent advances in hybrid integration of soliton microcombs at microwave line rates, ultra-low loss silicon nitride waveguides, and high speed on-chip detectors and modulators, our approach provides a path towards full CMOS wafer-scale integration of the photonic tensor core. While we focus on convolution processing, more generally our results indicate the major potential of integrated photonics for parallel, fast, and efficient computational hardware in demanding AI applications such as autonomous driving, live video processing, and next generation cloud computing services.",

Due to the increasing memory intensity of most DNN workloads, main memory can dominate the system's energy consumption and stall time. One effective way to reduce the energy consumption and increase the performance of DNN inference systems is by using approximate memory, which operates with reduced supply voltage and reduced access latency parameters that violate standard specifications. Using approximate memory reduces reliability, leading to higher bit error rates. Fortunately, neural networks have an intrinsic capacity to tolerate increased bit errors. This can enable energy-efficient and high-performance neural network inference using approximate DRAM devices.\nBased on this observation, we propose EDEN, a general framework that reduces DNN energy consumption and DNN evaluation latency by using approximate DRAM devices, while strictly meeting a user-specified target DNN accuracy. EDEN relies on two key ideas: 1) retraining the DNN for a target approximate DRAM device to increase the DNN's error tolerance, and 2) efficient mapping of the error tolerance of each individual DNN data type to a corresponding approximate DRAM partition in a way that meets the user-specified DNN accuracy requirements.\nWe evaluate EDEN on multi-core CPUs, GPUs, and DNN accelerators with error models obtained from real approximate DRAM devices. For a target accuracy within 1% of the original DNN, our results show that EDEN enables 1) an average DRAM energy reduction of 21%, 37%, 31%, and 32% in CPU, GPU, and two DNN accelerator architectures, respectively, across a variety of DNNs, and 2) an average (maximum) speedup of 8% (17%) and 2.7% (5.5%) in CPU and GPU architectures, respectively, when evaluating latency-bound DNNs.",

Past works have explored modeling the non-idealities using analytical techniques. However, several non-idealities have data dependent behavior. This can not be captured using analytical (non data-dependent) models thereby, limiting their suitability in predicting application accuracy.\nTo address this, we propose a Generalized Approach to Emulating Non-Ideality in Memristive Crossbars using Neural Networks (GENIEx), which accurately captures the data-dependent nature of non-idealities. We perform extensive HSPICE simulations of crossbars with different voltage and conductance combinations. Following that, we train a neural network to learn the transfer characteristics of the non-ideal crossbar. Next, we build a functional simulator which includes key architectural facets such as \\textit{tiling}, and \\textit{bit-slicing} to analyze the impact of non-idealities on the classification accuracy of large-scale neural networks. We show that GENIEx achieves \\textit{low} root mean square errors (RMSE) of $0.25$ and $0.7$ for low and high voltages, respectively, compared to HSPICE. Additionally, the GENIEx errors are $7\\times$ and $12.8\\times$ better than an analytical model which can only capture the linear non-idealities. Further, using the functional simulator and GENIEx, we demonstrate that an analytical model can overestimate the degradation in classification accuracy by $\\ge 10\\%$ on CIFAR-100 and $3.7\\%$ on ImageNet datasets compared to GENIEx.",

Quantum circuits based on Clifford+T gates are used as they can be made tolerant to noise. The tradeoff of gaining fault tolerance from using Clifford+T gates and error correcting codes is the high implementation overhead of the T gate. As a result, the T-count performance measure has become important in quantum circuit design. Due to noise, the risk for errors in a quantum circuit computation increases as the number of gate layers (or depth) in the circuit increases. As a result, low depth circuits such as quantum carry lookahead adders (QCLA)s have caught the attention of researchers. This work presents two QCLA designs each optimized with emphasis on T-count or qubit cost respectively. In-place and out-of-place versions of each design are shown. The proposed QCLAs are compared against the existing works in terms of T-count. The proposed QCLAs for out-of-place addition achieve average T gate savings of $54.34 \\%$ and $37.21 \\%$, respectively.

To achieve a low computational cost in a control modular adder, we focus on minimizing KQ, defined by the product of the number of qubits and the depth of the circuit. In this paper, we construct an efficient control modular adder with small KQ by using relative-phase Toffoli gates in two major types of quantum computers: Fault-Tolerant Quantum Computers (FTQ) on the Logical layer and Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum Computers (NISQ). We give a more efficient construction compared to Van Meter and Itoh's, based on a carry-lookahead adder. In FTQ, $T$ gates incur heavy cost due to distillation, which fabricates ancilla for running $T$ gates with high accuracy but consumes a lot of specially prepared ancilla qubits and a lot of time. Thus, we must reduce the number of $T$ gates. We propose a new control modular adder that uses only 20% of the number of $T$ gates of the original. Moreover, when we take distillation into consideration, we find that we minimize $\\text{KQ}_{T}$ (the product of the number of qubits and $T$-depth) by running $\\Theta\\left(n / \\sqrt{\\log n} \\right)$ $T$ gates simultaneously. In NISQ, CNOT gates are the major error source. We propose a new control modular adder that uses only 35% of the number of CNOT gates of the original. Moreover, we show that the $\\text{KQ}_{\\text{CX}}$ (the product of the number of qubits and CNOT-depth) of our circuit is 38% of the original.

To do so, we give the first complete resource estimates for useful quantum derivative pricing, using autocallable and Target Accrual Redemption Forward (TARF) derivatives as benchmark use cases. We uncover blocking challenges in known approaches and introduce a new method for quantum derivative pricing - the re-parameterization method - that avoids them. This method combines pre-trained variational circuits with fault-tolerant quantum computing to dramatically reduce resource requirements. We find that the benchmark use cases we examine require 8k logical qubits and a T-depth of 54 million. We estimate that quantum advantage would require executing this program at the order of a second. While the resource requirements given here are out of reach of current systems, we hope they will provide a roadmap for further improvements in algorithms, implementations, and planned hardware architectures.",

Previous algorithms had optimal or near-optimal scaling in some parameters at the cost of poor scaling in others. Hamiltonian simulation via a quantum walk has optimal dependence on the sparsity at the expense of poor scaling in the allowed error. In contrast, an approach based on fractional-query simulation provides optimal scaling in the error at the expense of poor scaling in the sparsity. Here we combine the two approaches, achieving the best features of both. By implementing a linear combination of quantum walk steps with coefficients given by Bessel functions, our algorithm's complexity (as measured by the number of queries and 2-qubit gates) is logarithmic in the inverse error, and nearly linear in the product $\\tau$ of the evolution time, the sparsity, and the magnitude of the largest entry of the Hamiltonian. Our dependence on the error is optimal, and we prove a new lower bound showing that no algorithm can have sublinear dependence on $\\tau$.",

In this paper, we propose a quantum amplitude estimation algorithm without the use of expensive controlled operations; the key idea is to utilize the maximum likelihood estimation based on the combined measurement data produced from quantum circuits with different numbers of amplitude amplification operations.

Here, we analyze the dynamics of gradient descent for the training error of a class of variational quantum machine learning models. We define wide quantum neural networks as parameterized quantum circuits in the limit of a large number of qubits and variational parameters.

Recently, it has been shown that models with little to no inductive biases (i.e., with no assumptions about the problem embedded in the model) are likely to have trainability and generalization issues, especially for large problem sizes. As such, it is fundamental to develop schemes that encode as much information as available about the problem at hand. In this work we present a simple, yet powerful, framework where the underlying invariances in the data are used to build QML models that, by construction, respect those symmetries. These so-called group-invariant models produce outputs that remain invariant under the action of any element of the symmetry group $\\mathfrak{G}$ associated to the dataset. We present theoretical results underpinning the design of $\\mathfrak{G}$-invariant models, and exemplify their application through several paradigmatic QML classification tasks including cases when $\\mathfrak{G}$ is a continuous Lie group and also when it is a discrete symmetry group. Notably, our framework allows us to recover, in an elegant way, several well known algorithms for the literature, as well as to discover new ones. Taken together, we expect that our results will help pave the way towards a more geometric and group-theoretic approach to QML model design.",

How to learn a unitary transformation efficiently is a fundamental problem in quantum machine learning. The most natural and leading strategy is to train a quantum machine learning model based on a quantum dataset. Although the presence of more training data results in better models, using too much data reduces the efficiency of training. In this work, we solve the problem on the minimum size of sufficient quantum datasets for learning a unitary transformation exactly, which reveals the power and limitation of quantum data. First, we prove that the minimum size of a dataset with pure states is $2^n$ for learning an $n$-qubit unitary transformation. To fully explore the capability of quantum data, we introduce a practical quantum dataset consisting of $n+1$ elementary tensor product states that are sufficient for exact training. The main idea is to simplify the structure utilizing decoupling, which leads to an exponential improvement in the size of the datasets with pure states. Furthermore, we show that the size of the quantum dataset with mixed states can be reduced to a constant, which yields an optimal quantum dataset for learning a unitary. We showcase the applications of our results in oracle compiling and Hamiltonian simulation. Notably, to accurately simulate a 3-qubit one-dimensional nearest-neighbor Heisenberg model, our circuit only uses $96$ elementary quantum gates, which is significantly less than $4080$ gates in the circuit constructed by the Trotter-Suzuki product formula.",

The structure of the underlying autoencoder network can be chosen to represent the data on a smaller dimension, effectively compressing the input. Inspired by this idea, we introduce the model of a quantum autoencoder to perform similar tasks on quantum data. The quantum autoencoder is trained to compress a particular dataset of quantum states, where a classical compression algorithm cannot be employed.

Some QNNs with specific encoding methods can be efficiently simulated by classical surrogates, while others with quantum memory may perform better than classical classifiers. Here we systematically investigate the problem-dependent power of quantum neural classifiers (QCs) on multi-class classification tasks. Through the analysis of expected risk, a measure that weighs the training loss and the generalization error of a classifier jointly, we identify two key findings: first, the training loss dominates the power rather than the generalization ability; second, QCs undergo a U-shaped risk curve, in contrast to the double-descent risk curve of deep neural classifiers. We also reveal the intrinsic connection between optimal QCs and the Helstrom bound and the equiangular tight frame. Using these findings, we propose a method that uses loss dynamics to probe whether a QC may be more effective than a classical classifier on a particular learning task. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach to explain the superiority of QCs over multilayer Perceptron on parity datasets and their limitations over convolutional neural networks on image datasets. Our work sheds light on the problem-dependent power of QNNs and offers a practical tool for evaluating their potential merit.",

When applied to tasks involving classical data, such algorithms generally begin with quantum circuits for data encoding and then train quantum neural networks (QNNs) to minimize target functions. Although QNNs have been widely studied to improve these algorithms' performance on practical tasks, there is a gap in systematically understanding the influence of data encoding on the eventual performance. In this paper, we make progress in filling this gap by considering the common data encoding strategies based on parameterized quantum circuits. We prove that, under reasonable assumptions, the distance between the average encoded state and the maximally mixed state could be explicitly upper-bounded with respect to the width and depth of the encoding circuit. This result in particular implies that the average encoded state will concentrate on the maximally mixed state at an exponential speed on depth. Such concentration seriously limits the capabilities of quantum classifiers, and strictly restricts the distinguishability of encoded states from a quantum information perspective. We further support our findings by numerically verifying these results on both synthetic and public data sets. Our results highlight the significance of quantum data encoding in machine learning tasks and may shed light on future encoding strategies.",

Since quantum systems produce counter-intuitive patterns believed not to be efficiently produced by classical systems, it is reasonable to postulate that quantum computers may outperform classical computers on machine learning tasks. The field of quantum machine learning explores how to devise and implement concrete quantum software that offers such advantages. Recent work has made clear that the hardware and software challenges are still considerable but has also opened paths towards solutions.",

A strategy for NISQ algorithms is to reduce the circuit depth at the expense of increasing the qubit count. Here, we exploit this trade-off for an application called entanglement spectroscopy, where one computes the entanglement of a state $| \\psi \\rangle$ on systems $AB$ by evaluating the R\u00e9nyi entropy of the reduced state $\\rho_A = {\\rm Tr}_B(| \\psi \\rangle \\langle \\psi |)$. For a $k$-qubit state $\\rho(k)$, the R\u00e9nyi entropy of order $n$ is computed via ${\\rm Tr}(\\rho(k)^{n})$, with the complexity growing exponentially in $k$ for classical computers. Johri, Steiger, and Troyer [PRB 96, 195136 (2017)] introduced a quantum algorithm that requires $n$ copies of $| \\psi \\rangle$ and whose depth scales linearly in $k*n$. Here, we present a quantum algorithm requiring twice the qubit resources ($2n$ copies of $| \\psi \\rangle$) but with a depth that is independent of both $k$ and $n$. Surprisingly this depth is only two gates. Our numerical simulations show that this short depth leads to an increased robustness to noise.",

Asymptotic analysis of quantum algorithms based on QSP has shown that asymptotically optimal results can in principle be obtained for a range of tasks, such as Hamiltonian simulation and the quantum linear system problem. A further benefit of QSP is that it uses a minimal number of ancilla qubits, which facilitates its implementation on near-to-intermediate term quantum architectures. However, there is so far no classically stable algorithm allowing computation of the phase factors that are needed to build QSP circuits. Existing methods require the usage of variable precision arithmetic and can only be applied to polynomials of relatively low degree. We present here an optimization based method that can accurately compute the phase factors using standard double precision arithmetic operations. We demonstrate the performance of this approach with applications to Hamiltonian simulation, eigenvalue filtering, and the quantum linear system problems. Our numerical results show that the optimization algorithm can find phase factors to accurately approximate polynomials of degree larger than $10,000$ with error below $10^{-12}$.",

Here we present an algorithm for Hermitian-operator function design from an oracle given by the unitary evolution with respect to that operator at a fixed time. Our algorithm implements a Fourier approximation of the target function based on the iteration of a basic sequence of single-qubit gates, for which we prove the expressibility. In addition, we present an efficient classical algorithm for calculating its parameters from the Fourier series coefficients. Our algorithm uses only one qubit ancilla regardless the degree of the approximating series. This contrasts with previous proposals, which required an ancillary register of size growing with the expansion degree.

Among its many connections to various mathematical and physical areas, it is known (due to Witten) to be intimately connected to Topological Quantum Field Theory (TQFT). The works of Freedman, Kitaev, Larsen and Wang provide an efficient simulation of TQFT by a quantum computer, and vice versa. These results implicitly imply the existence of an efficient quantum algorithm that provides a certain additive approximation of the Jones polynomial at the fifth root of unity, e^{2\\pi i/5}, and moreover, that this problem is BQP-complete. Unfortunately, this important algorithm was never explicitly formulated. Moreover, the results mentioned are heavily based on TQFT, which makes the algorithm essentially inaccessible to computer scientists.\nWe provide an explicit and simple polynomial quantum algorithm to approximate the Jones polynomial of an n-strands braid with m crossings at any primitive root of unity e^{2\\pi i/k}, where the running time of the algorithm is polynomial in m,n and k. Our algorithm is based, rather than on TQFT, on well known mathematical results. By the results of Freedman et. al., our algorithm solves a BQP complete problem.\nThe algorithm we provide exhibits a structure which we hope is generalizable to other quantum algorithmic problems. Candidates of particular interest are the approximations of other #P-hard problems, most notably, the partition function of the Potts model, a model which is known to be tightly connected to the Jones polynomial.",

Specifically, we show that a $d$-sparse Hamiltonian $H$ acting on $n$ qubits can be simulated for time $t$ with precision $\\epsilon$ using $O\\big(\\tau \\frac{\\log(\\tau/\\epsilon)}{\\log\\log(\\tau/\\epsilon)}\\big)$ queries and $O\\big(\\tau \\frac{\\log^2(\\tau/\\epsilon)}{\\log\\log(\\tau/\\epsilon)}n\\big)$ additional 2-qubit gates, where $\\tau = d^2 \\|{H}\\|_{\\max} t$. Unlike previous approaches based on product formulas, the query complexity is independent of the number of qubits acted on, and for time-varying Hamiltonians, the gate complexity is logarithmic in the norm of the derivative of the Hamiltonian. Our algorithm is based on a significantly improved simulation of the continuous- and fractional-query models using discrete quantum queries, showing that the former models are not much more powerful than the discrete model even for very small error. We also simplify the analysis of this conversion, avoiding the need for a complex fault correction procedure. Our simplification relies on a new form of \"oblivious amplitude amplification\" that can be applied even though the reflection about the input state is unavailable.

We study the problem of obtaining estimates to within a multiplicative factor $\\gamma>1$ of the Shannon entropy of probability distributions and the von Neumann entropy of mixed quantum states. Our main results are:\n$\\quad\\bullet$ an $\\widetilde{\\mathcal{O}}\\left( n^{\\frac{1+\\eta}{2\\gamma^2}}\\right)$-query quantum algorithm that outputs a $\\gamma$-multiplicative approximation of the Shannon entropy $H(\\mathbf{p})$ of a classical probability distribution $\\mathbf{p} = (p_1,\\ldots,p_n)$;\n$\\quad\\bullet$ an $\\widetilde{\\mathcal{O}}\\left( n^{\\frac12+\\frac{1+\\eta}{2\\gamma^2}}\\right)$-query quantum algorithm that outputs a $\\gamma$-multiplicative approximation of the von Neumann entropy $S(\\rho)$ of a density matrix $\\rho\\in\\mathbb{C}^{n\\times n}$.\nIn both cases, the input is assumed to have entropy bounded away from zero by a quantity determined by the parameter $\\eta>0$, since, as we prove, no polynomial query algorithm can multiplicatively approximate the entropy of distributions with arbitrarily low entropy. In addition, we provide $\\Omega\\left(n^{\\frac{1}{3\\gamma^2}}\\right)$ lower bounds on the query complexity of $\\gamma$-multiplicative estimation of Shannon and von Neumann entropies.\nWe work with the quantum purified query access model, which can handle both classical probability distributions and mixed quantum states, and is the most general input model considered in the literature.",

To this end, we aim to identify a practical problem that is beyond the reach of current classical computers, but that requires the fewest resources for a quantum computer. We consider quantum simulation of spin systems, which could be applied to understand condensed matter phenomena. We synthesize explicit circuits for three leading quantum simulation algorithms, employing diverse techniques to tighten error bounds and optimize circuit implementations. Quantum signal processing appears to be preferred among algorithms with rigorous performance guarantees, whereas higher-order product formulas prevail if empirical error estimates suffice. Our circuits are orders of magnitude smaller than those for the simplest classically-infeasible instances of factoring and quantum chemistry.",

                        "Citation Paper Abstract": "Abstract:Simulating the unitary dynamics of a quantum system is a fundamental problem of quantum mechanics, in which quantum computers are believed to have significant advantage over their classical counterparts. One prominent such instance is the simulation of electronic dynamics, which plays an essential role in chemical reactions, non-equilibrium dynamics, and material design. These systems are often time-dependent, which requires that the corresponding simulation algorithm can be successfully concatenated with itself over different time intervals to reproduce the overall coherent quantum dynamics of the system. In this paper, we quantify such simulation algorithms by a property called fully-coherent: the algorithm succeeds with arbitrarily high success probability $1-\\delta$, while only requiring a single copy of the initial state. We subsequently develop fully-coherent simulation algorithms based on quantum signal processing (QSP), including a novel algorithm that circumvents the use of amplitude amplification while also achieving a query complexity additive in time $t$, $\\ln(1/\\delta)$, and $\\ln(1/\\epsilon)$ for error tolerance $\\epsilon$: $\\Theta\\big( \\|\\mathcal{H}\\| |t| + \\ln(1/\\epsilon) + \\ln(1/\\delta)\\big)$. Furthermore, we numerically analyze these algorithms by applying them to the simulation of the spin dynamics of the Heisenberg model and the correlated electronic dynamics of an H$_2$ molecule. Since any electronic Hamiltonian can be mapped to a spin Hamiltonian, our algorithm can efficiently simulate time-dependent ab initio electronic dynamics in the circuit model of quantum computation. Accordingly, it is also our hope that the present work serves a bridge between QSP-based quantum algorithms and chemical dynamics, stimulating a cross-fertilization between these exciting fields.",

This paper shows how to perform the quantum singular value transformation for a matrix that can be embedded as a block of a Hamiltonian. The transformation can be implemented in a purely Hamiltonian context by the alternating application of Hamiltonians for chosen intervals: it is an example of the Quantum Alternating Operator Ansatz (generalized QAOA). We also show how to use the Hamiltonian quantum singular value transformation to perform inverse block encoding to implement a unitary of which a given Hamiltonian is a block. Inverse block encoding leads to novel procedures for matrix multiplication and for solving differential equations on quantum information processors in a purely Hamiltonian fashion.",
